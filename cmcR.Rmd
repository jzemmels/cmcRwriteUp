  Scientific research is driven by our ability to use existing methods, procedures, and materials from previous studies and further this research by adding to it. As the need for computationally-intensive methods to analyze large amount of data grows, the criteria needed to achieve reproducibility, specifically computational reproducibility, have become more sophisticated. In general, prosaic descriptions of algorithms, are not detailed or precise enough to ensure a complete reproducibility of a method. Results may be sensitive to conditions not commonly specified in written-word descriptions such as implicit parameter settings or the programming language used. To achieve true computational reproducibility, it is necessary to provide all intermediate data and code used to produce published results. In this paper, we consider a class of algorithms developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to perform firearm evidence identification on cartridge case evidence known as the \dfn{Congruent Matching Cells} (CMC) methods. To date, only textual descriptions of these algorithms have been published. We introduce the first open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells methods in the R package \pkg{cmcR} and use it to illustrate problems that arise when only computationally ambiguous descriptions of algorithms are provided.

\hh{XXX could we please cut back on the phrase 'discussed in the CMC literature'? It's  terribly vague - right now there's only a handful of CMC papers. let's not make all of that 'literature'. The phrase also sounds all-inclusive and that's not true by definition for future work, so let's not undermine ourselves by repeating this phrase over and over.  }

# Introduction {#intro}
\dfn{Research reproducibility}  refers to the ability to use the same procedures and materials as a previous study to arrive at the same results or conclusions. 
Reproducibility is indispensable for results to be considered valid by the wider scientific community \citep{goodman_what_2016}. Unfortunately, we cannot take reproducibility for granted:
 recent studies have raised concerns about reproducibility of scientific findings in various fields [\citet{king_replication_1995}, \citet{baker_1500_2016}, \citet{pasquier_if_2017}]. 
Commonly identified reasons for this lack of reproducibility include (1) ambiguity in how procedures
were implemented, (2) missing or incomplete data, and (3) missing or incomplete computer code to replicate all statistical analyses \citep{leek_is_2017}. 

In computational research, reproducibility of results is commonly translated to mean that the code and data used to produce published results be made publicly available \citep{peng_reproducible_2011}. However, current status quo is that many papers describe the computational methods which were used in the data analysis in broad terms only. Computational reproducibility requires more details: 
published results may be numerically sensitive to the particular implementation of a computational method, including such considerations as data processing decisions, parameter settings, and even the chosen programming language. 
As such, peer-review and scientific progress in the truest sense requires that \emph{all} pre-processed data, code, and results be made openly available. 
In recognition of the additional requirements of computational reproducibility,  some journals have adopted policies encouraging or requiring that authors provide code and data sufficient to reproduce the statistical analyses, with the goal of building a "culture of reproducibility" in their respective fields \citep{peng_reproducible_2009, peng_reproducible_2011, stodden_toward_2013}. 

The fundamental reason that descriptions of data analysis procedures, combined with the raw data, are not sufficient for reproducibility is that published procedures are described in words rather than algorithmically,  and in some cases, steps are performed manually <!--\citep{song_estimating_2018}--> without providing the resulting intermediary outcomes. If the written-language description of the method in the publication is the sole source of information about the algorithm, we trade computational reproducibility for readability. We generally do not describe the particular parameter settings used (or how those were derived) when we describe an algorithm in a publication. This is an understandable editorial decision, as the purpose of a publication is to demonstrate and justify the method rather than discuss the fine details and parameter settings. Because publications generally do not contain sufficient detail to reproduce every part of the algorithm, it is necessary to supplement the paper with open code and intermediate forms of the data (after any manual steps have been performed or simply as check points for replications). Especially in applications like forensic science or medicine, where results from computational methods may directly affect an individual's life, transparency in how a method or algorithm is implemented is necessary \citep{angwin_machine_2016, cino_deploying_2018}.

In this light, computational reproducibility  in forensic science, is all the more important because it fundamentally enables discussions about algorithmic transparency and accountability \citep{kwongAlgorithmSaysYou2017, desaiTrustVerifyGuide2017}. 
Currently, subjective decisions are made by individual examiners -- human beings are the ultimate closed-source, black-box system, and the operations which lead to a decision are largely opaque. 
\hh{The \citet{council_strengthening_2009} has pushed to} complement these subjective decisions with automatic algorithms that objectively assess evidence and can be explained during court testimony.
\hh{It furthermore} is \hh{of the utmost importantance} that the community does not go only halfway, trading a subjective, human black box for objective, proprietary algorithms that are similarly opaque and unauditable.
As part of the shift towards objectivity in forensic science, automatic methods have  been developed to solve problems such as identifying matching glass shards \citep{park2019}, handwriting \citep{crawford_handwriting_2020}, shoe prints \citep{park_algorithm_2020}, and ballistic evidence \citep{hare_automatic_2016,tai_fully_2018}. 
However, many of the algorithms described in the literature are not reproducible or open-source.
In this paper, we will demonstrate the ambiguities present in textual descriptions of algorithms by creating an open-source implementation of one well-known automatic forensic identification method.
The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) algorithm was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2012 to perform firearm evidence identification using identifiable markings left on spent cartridge cases from a firearm's barrel \citep{song_proposed_2013}. 
Since then, the method and its numerous extensions \citep{tong_improved_2015,chen_convergence_2017,song_estimating_2018} have shown promise in being able to differentiate between matching and non-matching cartridge cases. 
While NIST researchers and collaborators have been able to build on the foundation of the original algorithm, the code and data necessary to reproduce the results have not been made available to external researchers.
As a result, the findings described in those papers are not computationally reproducible for the research community at large.


Here, we describe the process of implementing the Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method for the comparison of marks on spent cartridge cases, using the descriptions from two published papers, \citet{song_3d_2014} and \citet{tong_improved_2015}. 
Our R package \citep{R}, \pkg{cmcR}, provides an open-source implementation of the CMC method, but it also serves as an example of the implementation barriers which occur when translating textual descriptions of algorithms into detailed source code. 
This process offers some insight into the necessary components which must be available for computational reproducibility. 
Our experience shows that when faced with ambiguity in how a method is implemented, there are only few options available to us apart from performing  brute-force searches through combinations of decisions that may have yielded the results reported. 
Unsurprisingly, the process is both time absorbing and computationally intensive from implementation to sifting through a wide variety of decision combinations.
The failure to ensure computational reproducibility not only imposes a general barrier to scientific progress; in this application, it also highlights the crucial need of open-source, transparent methodology in high-stakes fields such as forensic analysis.

We will use the same data set which is referenced in \citet{song_3d_2014} and \citet{tong_improved_2015} to illustrate usage of the \pkg{cmcR} package. These 3d scans of cartridge cases are available from the NIST Ballistics Toolmark Research Database \citep[NBTRD;][]{nbtrd}. The strings defined below refer to three cartridge case scans available on the NBTRD from \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate} and will be used throughout the remainder of this paper.

In the remainder of this paper, we \hh{first describe some of the background of forensic comparisons of breech face impressions, we then follow with a description of}  the implementation of a general CMC method which encompasses methods \hh{discussed} in \citet{song_proposed_2013}, \citet{song_3d_2014}, and \citet{tong_improved_2015}.
\citet{song_proposed_2013} lays out the conceptual framework for the original CMC method  later implemented in \citet{song_3d_2014} and \cite{tong_fired_2014}. An improvement of the method presented in \citet{tong_improved_2015} and used in subsequent papers is referred to as the ``High CMC" method \citep{chen_convergence_2017}. Both implementations (and further proposed improvements) have been shown to correctly differentiate same and different-source cartridge cases from the \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate} data set.

The \pkg{cmcR} package contains implementations designed for use with 3D topographical scans of the original method described in \citet{song_proposed_2013} and \citet{song_3d_2014} and the High CMC method described in \citet{tong_improved_2015}. The source code to the full `cmcR` package is accessible at https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/cmcR.




# Cartridge cases & breech face impressions {#cartridgeCases_bfImpressions}

A \dfn{cartridge case} is the portion of firearm ammunition that encases a projectile (e.g., bullet, shots, or slug) along with the explosive used to propel the projectile through the firearm. 
When a firearm is discharged, the projectile is propelled down the barrel of the firearm, while the cartridge case is forced towards the back of the barrel. 
It strikes the back wall, known as the \dfn{breech face}, of the barrel with considerable force, thereby imprinting any markings on the breech face onto the cartridge case, creating the so-called \dfn{breech face impressions}.
These markings have been suggested to be unique to a firearm and are used in forensic examinations to determine whether two cartridge cases have been fired by the same handgun.

During a forensic examination, two pieces of ballistic evidence are  placed under a \dfn{comparison microscope}. Comparison microscopes allow for a side-by-side comparison of two objects within the same viewfinder, as seen in \ref{fig:ccPair_combined}. A pair of breech face images is aligned along the thin black line in the middle of the images. The degree to which these breech face markings \hh{can be aligned is} used to determine whether the two cartridge cases \hh{came from the same source}; i.e., were fired from the same firearm. 
These breech face impressions are considered to be a firearm's unique "fingerprint" left on a cartridge case \citep{firearm_id_thompson}.

```{r ,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='\\label{fig:ccPair_combined} A cartridge case pair with visible breech face impressions under a microscrope.  A thin line can be seen separating the two views. The degree to which the markings coincide is used to conclude whether the pair comes from the same source.',fig.pos='htbp',out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cartridgeCasePair_comparison_with_line.PNG")
```

\autoref{fig:ccPair_combined} is an example of an image coming from a comparison microscope used by firearms examiners in laboratory settings. Digital microscopy is capable of precision measurements of surface topology at even higher resolutions. Using a 3D microscope, we can obtain scans of breech face impressions at the micron level ($1 \mu m = 10^{-3} mm = 10^{-6} m$). 
These \hh{3d topological scans are} used as input to automated comparison algorithms, such as the CMC method originally proposed in \citet{song_proposed_2013}.


# The CMC method {#cmcMethod}

<!-- Transition -->
In this section, we examine the process of implementing the CMC method for automatic comparisons of 3D cartridge case scans. 
At each step, we will compare the description in the published papers with the implementation in code, discussing the gaps in the method description and how we filled in those gaps during the creation of `cmcR`.

All of the CMC methods can be broken down into three broad stages: (1) preprocessing, (2) cell-based similarity feature extraction, and (3) application of a decision rule as illustrated in \autoref{fig:overview-flow}.
In the following sections we break each of these stages further into a set of modular steps.
One advantage of modularizing these algorithms is that we can implement an algorithm as a  set of sequential procedures.
This allows us to then test new variations against the old implementation in a coherent, unified framework.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/overview-flow.png}
\caption{The stages of CMC methods. In the preprocessing stage, each scan is prepared for analysis, removing extraneous information and noise. Then, each scan is broken up into cells, which are numerically compared to cells in the other scan to determine an optimal alignment. Finally, each of the scores arising from the cells in the second stage are compared to a reference distribution to determine whether the scans originate from the same source or from different sources.\label{fig:overview-flow}}
\end{figure}


The primary difference between the original and high CMC methods \hh{lies in how} the decision rules are utilized to separate matches and non-matches. Beyond that there are also several small differences in the preprocessing and comparison procedures.
Current CMC literature lacks justification for changing these procedures. 
At the same time, different conditions have been shown to yield very different results; even when applying the same decision rule. 
This sensitivity of various methods to different conditions has also not been discussed \hh{appropriately}.


In this section, we discuss each stage of the CMC method using excerpts from the original papers.
Then, we examine the implementation of each sub-procedure in the \pkg{cmcR} package, considering the differences between the textual description and its algorithmic translation.


## Initial Data {#initialData}
Cartridge case scans are commonly stored in the ISO standard x3p file format \citep{ISO25178-72}.  x3p is a \hh{container format which} consists of a single surface matrix representing the height value of the breech face surface and metadata concerning the parameters under which the scan was taken (size, resolution, creator, microscope, and microscopy software versions etc.). The \pkg{x3ptools} package \citep{x3ptools} \hh{provides elementary functionality to work with the format in R}.

<!-- \hh{XXXX x3p is a standard file format - we could cite both the ISO site and x3ptools as a way to work with them.} -->
\autoref{fig:cartridgeCasePair} shows the surface matrices of a known match (KM) pair of cartridge cases from a study by \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate}. 
A total of 40 cartridge cases were scanned with a lateral resolution of 6.25 microns (micrometers) per pixel. The surface matrices are approximately $1200 \times 1200$ pixels in size \hh{corresponding to an area of about $3.8 \times 3.8$ mm$^2$}.

Only certain regions of a cartridge case contain identifying breech face impression markings.
\citet{song_proposed_2013} defines "valid correlation regions" as regions where "the individual characteristics of the ballistics signature are found that can be used effectively for ballistics identification."
<!-- \hh{XXX how are these valid correlation regions defined? If they are not defined in detail, we should remark on that.} -->
Prior to applying the CMC comparison procedure, cartridge scans must undergo some preprocessing to \jz{emphasize these valid correlation regions}.

## Preprocessing procedures {#preProcessing}

<!-- First, raw 3D topographical cartridge case surface data need to be processed before applying the CMC method.  -->

During the preprocessing stage, \hh{a series of} sequential steps is used to prepare each cartridge case for analysis.  The goal of this process is to remove the edges and center of the scan which did not come into contact with \hh{XXX  a minimal (specify a number?) amount of}  the breech face, as well as any artifacts of the scan and microscope staging which do not accurately represent the breech face surface.


The different iterations of the CMC algorithm describe  different variations of these steps.
A summary of these steps is shown in \autoref{fig:preprocessing-schematic}.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/preprocessing_flow.png}
\caption{Overview of the set of pre-processing steps used in the CMC algorithms. Where a procedure step is not discussed or explicitly not applied in the paper, the path traverses empty space.}\label{fig:preprocessing-schematic}
\end{figure}

The implementation in \citet{tong_fired_2014} describes the preprocessing steps \hh{(for the 2d images)} as:

>  After trimming processing [sic] to remove unrelated correlations areas, the final image size is reduced to 700 × 700 pixel with an estimated pixel spacing of 5.0 $\mu$m. A Gaussian smoothing filter (standard deviation $\sigma$ = 1) was implemented first to remove high frequency noise.

Complicating the issue \hh{of preprocessing the scans}, the procedures used to process the surface matrices differ in each \hh{of the} paper\hh{s discussed here}. \citet{song_3d_2014} outline the following preprocessing procedure:

> Trim off the inside firing pin surface and other areas outside the breech face mark, so that only breech face impression data remain for correlation.

> Identify and remove dropouts or outliers.

> Apply a band-pass Gaussian regression filter with 40 $\mu$m short cutoff length and 400 $\mu$m long cutoff length to remove low frequency components, including surface curvature, form error, waviness and high frequency components which mainly arise from the instrument noise.

While not explicitly mentioned in \citet{song_3d_2014}, \citet{song_estimating_2018} indicates that the "trimming" of the unwanted regions of the scan is performed manually. 
No further information is given in the paper describing what criteria were used for this process; nor are the trimmed scans provided as intermediate data to make reproducibility possible. 

It is also unclear how the dropouts and outliers are "removed" from the scan or \hh{even} how outliers are defined; many different methods for outlier detection and removal are used in surface metrology \citep{outlierdetection}. Most of these algorithms require the user to select thresholds or parameters; thus, without any details about how the outlier detection process was implemented, this portion of the paper is not reproducible.

We are not aware of an open-source implementation of the multivariate band-pass Gaussian regression filter used in surface metrology \citep{ISO16610-71}. 
Further, there are various parameters requiring specification to implement a Gaussian regression filter and it is not clear how these parameters were chosen \citep{brinkman_bodschwinna_2003}.

As a result of these ambiguities, during our implementation of the preprocessing algorithm, we had to make several educated guesses in order to match the described procedure as closely as possible.

### Implementation of preprocessing procedures

<!-- \hh{XXX Joe, avoid passive voice when you are describing what you did. You need to emphasize that this is your work} -->
The preprocessing procedures are implemented via the modularized functions of the form \code{preProcess\_*}.
Modularizing the steps of the preprocessing procedures renders the overall preprocessing stage easier to understand and \hh{allows for} experimentation.
\autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows how the \code{preProcess\_*} functions affect the surface matrix values of the Fadul 1-1 scan.

```

We demonstrate usage of the \code{preProcess\_*} functions on the Fadul 1-1 scan. 
Each code chunk is followed up with an explanation of the functions used.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (1)
fadul1.1 <- x3ptools::x3p_read("data/fadul1-1.x3p")
```

We begin with a 3D scan, which is optionally downsampled. 
Typically, in the CMC literature, every other row and column in the surface matrix is retained, resulting in a matrix that is approximately 25% of the original scan dimension. 
This downsampling is performed using the \code{x3p\_sample} function from the \pkg{x3ptools} package (default is every other row and column).
\jz{The \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate} were initially scanned at a resolution of 3.125 $\mu$m per pixel, so downsampling reduces the resolution to 6.25 $\mu$m per pixel.}
<!-- \hh{XXX what is the resolution at that point?} -->
Step (1) in \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows an unprocessed breech face scan.

<!-- \hh{XXX can we get away from the surface matrix and call it a breech face scan? That's gettign away from how it's implemented towards what it is.} -->

<!-- \hh{XXX minor thing, but let's call the things exactly how they are defined. It's not Step 1, its (1) in Figure 5.} -->

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (2)
fadul1.1_cropped <- fadul1.1%>%
  cmcR::preProcess_crop(region = "exterior") %>%
  cmcR::preProcess_crop(region = "interior")
```

Three major regions of the scan are identified as described in \citet{hesselink_concurrent_2001} and available in the \pkg{imager} package \citep{imager}. 
These regions are the \hh{circle capturing the} exterior of the cartridge case primer, the breech face impression region, and the \hh{circle around the} firing pin impression hole in the center of the scan. 

The goal is to isolate the breech face impression region by removing (i.e., replacing with \code{NA}) the pixels in the other two regions.
Upon labeling the different regions of the cartridge case scan, the centers and radii of the cartridge case primer and firing pin impression hole are estimated. 
This estimation procedure may require some user input depending on how much of the exterior/interior the user wants removed.
The resulting breech face scan, like the one shown in step (2) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}, is reproducible assuming the same user-specified settings are used (if they are used at all).
<!--This is in contrast to the non-reproducible, manual procedure referenced in other CMC papers to isolate the breech face impression region.-->
The \code{preProcess\_crop} function removes the exterior and firing pin impression region on the interior based on the \code{region} argument.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (3)
fadul1.1_deTrended <- fadul1.1_cropped %>%
  preProcess_removeTrend(statistic = "quantile",
                         tau = .5,
                         method = "fn")
```


\hh{In Step 3} any existing large-scale trend  in the breech face scan height values \hh{are removed}. In steps (1) and (2) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} it is clear that there is a southwest-to-northeast trend in height values. 
Such a trend is observable in many cartridge case scans, yet does not occur consistently across cartridge cases fired from the same firearm. \hh{This indicates that a trend in height values is  likely to be an} 
 artifact of the scanning process \hh{resulting from }  cartridge cases  not being precisely, horizontally leveled prior to taking the scan.
<!-- (XXX should we cite something about scanning SOP here? XXX).  -->
Neglecting to remove these trends leads to very different results based on our implementation. 
\hh{In an extreme situation,} two different-source cartridge cases with similar trends might be incorrectly deemed "congruent." 
<!--For authors that use something other than a Gaussian regression filter, it is unclear how such trends in height values are dealt with; certainly, a high-pass Gaussian filter will remove some structure, but \jz{it is not discussed in the CMC literature}-->
<!-- \hh{XXX which papers?} -->
<!--whether any leveling is performed manually as well.--> 
The \code{preProcess\_removeTrend} functions levels the breech face impression regions obtained from step (2). The function estimates and subtracts the conditional median via \hh{a quantile regression as implemented in} the \code{rq} function of the \pkg{quantreg} package \citep{quantreg}. Step (3) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows a median-leveled breech face scan.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (4)
fadul1.1_processed <- fadul1.1_deTrended %>%
  preProcess_gaussFilter(filtertype = "bp",
                         wavelength = c(16,500)) %>%
  x3ptools::x3p_sample(m = 2)
```


In the final preprocessing step, a band-pass filter is applied to the processed breech face scan to reduce the effects of undesired frequencies in the comparison procedure. 
For example, low frequency (high wavelength) global structure may exist in a cartridge case scan due to manufacturing specifications. In forensics, this type of structure is referred to as a class \hh{or subclass} characteristic -- it is shared by many objects of the same make and model. \hh{Class characteristics are}
 used by forensic practitioners to initially pare down the possible pool of matching cartridge cases \citep{firearm_id_thompson}. 
While this additional global structure may assist with matching cartridge cases, it can also artificially inflate the probability of making a false-positive identification. 
The goal of \hh{comparing breech-face scans is to answer the question of source. Same-sourceness can only be determined by matching individual} characteristics,  so the global structure \hh{is removed by} using a high-pass Gaussian filter. Similarly, \hh{a low-pass filter is used to remove} noise and outliers from cartridge case scans due to, for example, imperfections in the scanning process. 
<!--Such observations may also reduce the accuracy of our identifications. 
Their effects can be mitigated by applying a low-pass Gaussian filter that operates as a local, moving average. -->
A band-pass Gaussian filter combines the effects of low and high-pass filters; \hh{this is the default choice in `cmcR`}. 
<!-- \jz{and can be implemented} \svp{by applying the filters consecutively} \citep{gauss_filter_source} \jz{XXX I only say "can be" to emphasize that we chose one of the commonly agreed-upon ways to implement a band-pass filter XXX}.  -->
<!--There is considerable variation in the filters applied in the CMC literature; initially, low-pass and Gaussian band-pass regression filters were used, but the most recent papers use a band-pass filter.
The current implementation for the low-pass filter involves constructing a Gaussian kernel based on a user-specified wavelength to attenuate and convolving the kernel with the breech face scan in the frequency domain \citep{computerVision}. 
\hh{XXX the next sentence needs some work: 'a particular wavelength' is oddly specific - is it any particular wavelength? Can we find a replacement for 'subtracting-away'? Do we need the sentence at all? XXX}
A high-pass filter of a particular wavelength is applied by subtracting-away the complementary low-pass filtered breech face scan. -->
The band-pass filtered breech face scan as returned by the \code{preProcess\_gaussFilter} function is shown in the fourth panel of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}.
<!-- (\code{filterType = "bp"} and \code{wavelength = c(16,500)} default). -->

<!-- In the \pkg{cmcR} package, breech face impression data are isolated using a comthebination of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) robust iterative plane-fitting algorithm \citep{ransac}, the Hough Transform shape detection algorithm \citep{hough}, and cropping rows/columns of the breech face scan containing only \code{NA} values on the exterior of the breech face impression region.  -->
<!-- The \pkg{cmcR} package does not yet use a Gaussian regression filter. -->
<!-- A simpler Gaussian filter, a technique used by \citet{tong_fired_2014} and \citet{song_estimating_2018}, is currently implemented instead.  -->

<!-- In order to perform the comparison procedure, \code{NA}-valued pixels must be replaced with a non-\code{NA} value.  -->
<!-- The convention adopted in the \pkg{cmcR} package is to use the average pixel value as a replacement.  -->
<!-- \svp{XXX Do we know that they did or did not use a similar consensus in the CMC method? XXX} \jz{XXX No, we don't XXX} -->
There is currently no determination or removal of outliers in the \pkg{cmcR} package's preprocessing procedures. <!--, in part because \hh{in the available } contains limited details on outlier removal.--> Instead, we rely on the low-pass portion of the Gaussian filter to reduce the effects of any high-frequency noise.

<!-- To illustrate the usage of the \pkg{cmcR} package, we will consider a comparison between the KM cartridge case pair shown in \autoref{fig:cartridgeCasePair}. -->
\autoref{fig:processedScans} displays the processed Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 1-2 scans; the second matrix is processed using the same parameters. Similarity features are extracted from a processed cartridge case pair in the cell-based comparison procedure.

## "Correlation cell" comparison procedure {#comparisonProcedure}

<!-- \svp{XXX Need to quote directly from the relevant papers. Ideally, from the papers with implementations and not just theory.} -->

As described in \citet{song_proposed_2013}, breech face markings are not uniformly impressed upon a cartridge case during the firing process. 
As such, only certain sections of the cartridge case <!--have identifiable markings that make it possible to match to a firearm. --> \hh{are used in a comparison.}
<!--\hh{XXX That's just speculation} Calculating a similarity score between the entirety of two cartridge case surfaces might not highlight these valid correlation regions. 
Instead,--> 
\hh{In the CMC method as proposed by} \citet{song_proposed_2013} \hh{two scans are compared by} partitioning one breech face scan into a grid of \hh{so-called} "correlation cells". <!--some of which will enclose the valid correlation regions of interest. -->
\hh{These cells are compared individually to their best-matching counterpart on the other scan.} If a large \svp{proportion} of these correlation cells are highly similar to \hh{their counterparts on}  the other breech face scan, \hh{this is considered as} evidence that the \hh{markings on the} two cartridge cases \hh{were made by the same source}. \hh{The number of highly similar cells is defined as the }
 \dfn{CMC count} \citep{song_proposed_2013} \hh{of the breech-face comparison}. \hh{The CMC count is considered to be a more} \svp{robust} similarity metric \hh{than a cross-correlation score based on} the entire cartridge case.

\autoref{fig:cmc_illustration} illustrates the cell-based comparison procedure between two cartridge case scans. 
The scan on the left  \hh{serves as the reference; it is} divided into a grid of $k \times k$ cells. 
The cell size (and thus, the corresponding number of cells) is optimized experimentally:

> The cell size must be experimentally optimized, not too small and not too large. Either condition may result in low correlation accuracy. For the initial tests of 9 mm caliber cartridge cases, good correlation results for breech face correlations were obtained using the cell sizes ranging from (0.25 × 0.25) to (0.5 × 0.5) $mm^2$. \citep{song_3d_2014}

\hh{XXX note for the conclusion: how does a different resolution affect the correlations? }

\caption{Each CMC implementation uses slightly different procedures to obtain a similarity score between two cartridge cases. Steps which are implemented with additional user-specified parameters are shaded purple; steps which are described but without sufficient detail are shaded grey.}\label{fig:cmc-schematic}
\end{figure}

\svp{\autoref{fig:cmc-schematic} shows the steps of the correlation cell comparison process in each of the papers as well as the \pkg{cmcR} implementation.} Each cell is paired with an associated larger region in the other scan. 
The absolute location of each cell and region in their respective surface matrices remain constant. 
However, the scan on the right is rotated to determine the rotation at which the two scans are the most "similar," which is quantified using the \dfn{cross-correlation function} (CCF). 

For two real-valued, $M \times N$ matrices $A$ and $B$, the cross-correlation function, denoted $(A \star B)$ can be defined as
$$
(A \star B)[m,n] = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} A[i,j] B[(i + m), (j + n)].
$$
By this definition, the resulting CCF is a matrix whose $[m,n]$th element quantifies the similarity between matrices $A$ and $B$ for a translation of matrix $B$ by $m$ pixels horizontally and $n$ pixel vertically.
The index at which the CCF attains a maximum represents the \svp{optimal translation} needed to align $B$ with $A$.
\jz{The CCF as defined need not be bounded between $-1$ and $1$. However, it is common to normalize the CCF for interpretability, and} \svp{this} \jz{is the convention adopted by the \pkg{cmcR} package.}
Prior to calculating the CCF, the matrices $A$ and $B$ are standardized through subtraction of their respective means and division by their respective standard deviations. 
This is referred to as the \dfn{Areal Cross-Correlation Function} (ACCF) in some CMC papers \citep{ott_applying_2017}.
Calculation of the CCF for breech face scans based on the definition above is inhibitingly slow.
While computationally feasible alternatives exist, \citet{song_proposed_2013} and other CMC papers do not specify the algorithm used to calculate the CCF.

\svp{In \citet{song_3d_2014}, the comparison process is described with characteristic brevity:}

> CMC pairs are identified by three types of identification parameters: the correlation value CCF$_{\max}$, registration angle $\theta$ and translation distances $x$, $y$ with thresholds $T_{\text{CCF}}$, $T_\theta$ and $T_x, T_y$, respectively. The correlated cell pairs are considered as CMCs when their correlation value CCF$_{\max}$, $T_{\text{CCF}}$, and their registration angle $\theta$ and $x-y$ registration pattern are within the thresholds $T_\theta$, and $T_x, T_y$.

Note, that rotating an image or breech face scan by an arbitrary angle (other than a multiple of 90 degrees) requires interpolating new pixel locations. 
A variety of interpolation schemes exist \citep{parker_comparison_1983}, but there are no details provided in the \hh{papers under consideration} indicating which interpolation algorithm was used. In \pkg{cmcR}, surfaces matrices are rotated using a "nearest-neighbor" interpolation scheme \citep{imager}.

<!-- \svp{XXX what do we use? Make it explicit so we're not being hypocritical XXX} \jz{XXX nearest-neighbor interpolation -- this is stated in the paragraph below describing the implementation XXX} -->

<!-- \svp{For clarity and reproducibility, we will attempt to provide more precise mathematical and computational descriptions of the algorithm, starting with a definition of the cross-correlation function and later discuss more efficient computational implementations}. -->

In the next section, we discuss our implementation of the cell-based comparison procedure.

### Implementation of the correlation cell comparison procedure

\hh{All of} the steps \hh{dealing with } cell-based comparisons are implemented \hh{as functions of the form } \code{comparison\_*}.
Similar to the \code{preProcess\_*} functions, the \code{comparison\_*} functions can be chained together through a sequence of pipes.

Published implementations of the CMC algorithm do not describe precisely how the CCF is calculated. 
In image processing, it is common to use an implementation based on the Fast Fourier Transform \citep{Brown92asurvey}. 
This implementation leverages the Cross-Correlation Theorem, which states that for matrices $A$ and $B$, \hh{XXX write out the statement in a concise statement ahead of the math XXX}
$$
(A \star B )[m,n]= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\overline{\mathcal{F}(A)} \odot \mathcal{F}(B)\right)[m,n]
$$
where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote the discrete Fourier and inverse discrete Fourier transforms, respectively, and $\overline{\mathcal{F}(A)}$ denotes the complex conjugate \citep{fft_brigham}. 
Note that the multiplication on the right-hand side is pointwise (Hadamard) multiplication. 
This result allows us to trade the moving sum computations from the definition of the CCF for two forward Fourier transformation, a pointwise product, and an inverse Fourier transformation. 
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm can be used to reduce the computational load considerably.

\svp{No computational shortcut comes without some tradeoffs, though, and this FFT-based CCF calculation is no different. 
The FFT does not tolerate missing values, and breech faces are not continuous surfaces - the white regions in \autoref{fig:cmc_illustration} correspond to missing values.}
\svp{While it is unclear how the CCF is implemented in the CMC papers (it is not even defined mathematically), the \pkg{cmcR} package adopts the following conventions:}

- \svp{Missing values are replaced with the overall mean value when the FFT-based CCF is computed \jz{(via the \code{comparison\_replaceMissing} function)}.} 
- \svp{The optimal translation is determined using the FFT-based CCF \jz{(via the \code{comparison\_fft\_ccf} function)}. Replacing the missing values with the overall mean leads to a deflated CCF value, but produces an accurate estimate of the optimal translation.}
- \svp{Using the optimal translation determined from the FFT-based CCF, we compute the pairwise complete CCF directly, avoiding any distortion of the CCF computation based on compensation for missing values \jz{(via the \code{comparison\_cor} function)}.}

\jz{Only cells with a minimum proportion of non-missing pixels are }\svp{assessed}. \jz{The minimum threshold differs across CMC papers \citep{chen_convergence_2017,song_estimating_2018}}\svp{, as shown in \autoref{fig:cmc-schematic}, and is referenced but not specified in several other papers \citep{tong_fired_2014,song_3d_2014,chu_validation_2013}.}
\jz{The \code{comparison\_calcPropMissing} function computes the proportion of a matrix that is missing (\code{NA}-valued).}
<!-- \svp{XXX what proportion do we use? If it's variable, we should say that we have implemented this as a parameter setting for compatibility with the other algorithms} -->

<!-- \svp{The entire matching procedure is performed twice: once with scan A partitioned and scan B as the target, and once with scan B partitioned and scan A as the target.} -->
<!-- The correlation cell comparison procedure is implemented in the \code{cellCCF\_bothDirections} function.  -->

<!-- \svp{This chunk of code is 1) too dense, and 2) not particularly useful. Either take each function/step and show it line-by-line as you discuss the procedure, or just show the full function and say that it does the following steps. -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- \svp{Something like this might work better:} -->

\jz{The code below demonstrates how the \code{comparison\_allTogether} function can be used to perform the entire cell-based comparison procedure in one call. The comparison procedure is performed twice: once with Fadul 1-1 considered the "reference" scan divided into cells that are compared to the "target" scan Fadul 1-2 and again with the roles reversed.}

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
kmComparisonFeatures <- purrr::map_dfr(seq(-30,30,by = 3),
                                       ~ comparison_allTogether(reference = fadul1.1,
                                                                target = fadul1.2,

                                                                theta = .))

```

\svp{The \code{comparison\_allTogether} function consists of the following steps wrapped into a single convenience function:}

- Divide the reference scan into cells (`comparison_cellDivision`)
- Extract from the target scan the regions associated with each reference cell
  (`comparison_getTargetRegions`)
- Compute missing proportions (`comparison_calcPropMissing`)
- Standardize height values (`comparison_standardizeHeights`)
- Replace missing values (`comparison_replaceMissing`)
- Compute CCF and estimated translations using FFT (`comparison_fft_ccf`)
- Compute pairwise-complete correlation between a reference cell and a matrix of the same size extracted from the associated target region (`comparison_cor`)

\svp{As shown above, \jz{this sequence of} function\jz{s are} applied \jz{for} each $\theta$ value in sequence, rotating the target scan relative to the reference scan. When implementing the High CMC method, both combinations of reference and target scan are examined (e.g. A-B and B-A).}

\autoref{tab:cellCCF} shows several rows of the data frame output of the \code{comparison\_allTogether} function.
Although a grid of $8 \times 8$ cells were used, there were 27 cell/region pairs that contained a sufficient proportion of non-missing values (15% in this example).

## Decision Rule

\svp{Using the thetas, translation vectors, and CCFs produced by the correlation cell procedure, the CMC literature describes various methods for aggregating this information into a consensus decision about the similarity of the two cartridge cases.} 

As stated in \citet{song_3d_2014}, 

> [t]he qualifications of CMCs require not only high correlation values CCF$_{\max} \geq T_{\text{CCF}}$, but also similar registration angles $\theta$ (within the threshold $T_{\theta}$) and similar $x - y$ registration pattern (within the thresholds $T_x$, $T_y$).

A truly matching pair of cartridge cases \svp{would have similar translation and rotation values for each cell, estimated by maximizing the cell-wise CCF; a nonmatching pair of cartridge cases would have a variety of different translation and rotation values showing no particular pattern.}
\svp{\jz{Based on this observation, t}he first step in \jz{any CMC} decision process is to obtain a consensus estimate of $x, y, \theta$; these estimated values are then used in the evaluation of the alignment of each cell/region pair.
The consensus set of $x, y, \theta$ is} referred to as the \dfn{registration phase} of the cell/region pairs \citep{song_proposed_2013}.
\jz{Where the various CMC decision rules principally differ is in how they identify a "consensus" among the estimated $x,y, \theta$ values.}

In this section, we describe two \jz{decision rules} that are implemented in the \pkg{cmcR} package. These are the decision rules used in the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC of \citet{tong_improved_2015}.

### The original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} {#originalMethod}

\jz{This section briefly describes the decision rule of the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013}. For a thorough explanation of the procedure, refer to the} [CMC Decision Rule Description](https://csafe-isu.github.io/cmcR/articles/decisionRuleDescription.html) \jz{vignette in the \pkg{cmcR} package.}

\jz{An actual implementation of the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} is described in \citet{song_3d_2014}. The decision rule} \citet{song_3d_2014} describe using \jz{is based on}

> a virtual reference with three reference registration parameters $\theta_{\text{ref}}$, $x_{\text{ref}}$ and $y_{\text{ref}}$ generated by the median values of the collective $\theta$, and $x$-, $y$-translation values of all cell pairs.

That is, a consensus is determined by finding the median registration phase values across the cell/region pairs for a particular cartridge case pair comparison.
\svp{Then, the distances between the consensus registration values and the cell comparison values are assessed to determine whether they are within a specified distance of the consensus.}
\svp{This consensus assessment introduces threshold parameters $T_{x}, T_{y}, T_\theta, T_{\text{CCF}}$.
}

\svp{Let $x_i, y_i, \theta_i$ denote the translation and rotation parameters which produce the highest CCF for the alignment of cell/region pair $i$. A c}ell/region pair $i$ is declared a match if all of the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|x_i - x_{\text{ref}}| \leq T_{x}$ \\
\item $|y_i - y_{\text{ref}}| \leq T_{y}$ \\
\item $|\theta_i - \theta_{\text{ref}}| \leq T_{\theta}$ \\
\item CCF$_{\max,i} \geq T_{\text{CCF}}$.
\end{enumerate}

\citet{song_3d_2014} indicate that these thresholds need to be determined experimentally. 
There is little consensus on an optimal set of thresholds and no discussion of the sensitivity of proposed methods to different threshold choices in the CMC literature.
\jz{As such, there is little known about the effectiveness of the any CMC method to "out-of-bag" samples.
\autoref{tab:thresholdTable} summarizes the thresholds used in various CMC papers.}

    \caption{Each CMC implementation uses slightly different translation, rotation, and CCF$_{\max}$ thresholds to classify matches. There is currently no principled approach to determining these thresholds in the CMC literature. Instead, thresholds seem to be chosen by authors through experimentation and selecting thresholds that provide promising results.}
    \label{tab:thresholdTable}
\end{table}

The High CMC utilizes the behavior of the CCF$_{\max}$ values across various rotations more advantageously than the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013}. 
Additionally, comparisons are performed in both “directions” so that each breech face scan takes on the role of the reference scan that is partitioned into a grid of cells.


### The High CMC method {#highCMCMethod}

For the High CMC method, comparisons are performed in both "directions" so that each breech face scan takes on the role of the reference scan that is partitioned into a grid of cells.
The CMCs under the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} are calculated in each direction and their minimum is used as an "original CMC number."
However, as \citet{tong_improved_2015} observe, some truly matching cell pairs "may be mistakenly excluded from the CMC count" because they attain the largest CCF value at a rotation value outside the range allowed by $T_\theta$ "by chance."

<!-- {\jz{An analogy is useful for understanding the difference between the decision rules of the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC method. Consider the decision rules as a voting system by which each cell in the reference scan votes for what it considers to be the true registration phase (translations and rotation) of the overall scans. The "votes" of each cell are ranked based on the associated CCF$_{\max}$ value. The original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} might be viewed as a single-choice voting system similar to the system used in U.S. presidential elections. Every cell is allowed to submit one vote corresponding to the registration phase with the highest CCF$_{\max}$ value. Votes are discarded if the associated CCF value is below the $T_{\text{CCF}}$ threshold. A consensus is determined by counting the number of votes that are close to the reference values $x_{\text{ref}}, y_{\text{ref}}, \theta_{\text{ref}}$ (which is dyadically defined based on the $T_x,T_y,T_{\theta}$ thresholds). By considering only the "top vote" of each cell, information is lost regarding other registration phases for which a cell might also rank highly. As \citet{tong_improved_2015} observe:}} -->

<!-- \begin{quote} -->
<!-- some of the valid cell pairs may be mistakenly excluded from the CMC -->
<!-- count because by chance their correlation yields a higher CCF value at a -->
<!-- rotation angle outside the threshold range \(T_\theta\). -->
<!-- \end{quote} -->

As the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} only considers the alignment phase at which each cell attains a maximum CCF, it is not sensitive to these mistakenly excluded cell pairs. To combat this, \citet{tong_improved_2015} instead consider the number of cells with sufficiently large CCF values and translation phases close to reference values for each $\theta$. Let $(x_{i,\theta}, y_{i,\theta})'$ be the translation phase of cell $i$ associated with rotation $\theta \in \Theta$ and $CCF_{i,\theta}$ be the associated CCF value. Also let $(x_{ref,\theta}, y_{ref,\theta})' \equiv \text{median}\left(\{(x_{i,\theta}, y_{i,\theta})' : i = 1,...,n\}\right)$. 
If 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x_{ref,\theta} - x_{ref,\theta}| \leq T_x$,

\item $|y_{i,\theta} - y_{ref,\theta}| \leq T_y$,

\item and CCF$_{i,\theta} \geq T_{\text{CCF}}$
\end{itemize}
then we might consider cell $i$ as being a "potential" CMC at $\theta$.
In counting the number of potential CMCs for each $\theta$, we obtain what \citet{tong_improved_2015} refer to as a "CMC-$\theta$" distribution on $\Theta$.
\citet{tong_improved_2015} assert that for a truly matching cartridge case pair, this CMC-$\theta$ distribution should exhibit a "prominent peak" near the true rotation value at which the pair aligns.
In contrast, truly non-matching pairs should exhibit a "relatively flat and random CMC-$\theta$ distribution pattern."

Let $N_\theta$ be the number of potential CMCs at a particular $\theta \in \Theta$ and let $N \equiv \max_\theta\{N_\theta\}$. To determine whether a "prominent peak" exists in the CMC-$\theta$ distribution, \citet{tong_improved_2015} calculate the "angular range" $R \equiv$ range$\left(\{\theta : N_\theta \geq N - \tau\}\right)$ for some user-defined $\tau$. The $\theta$ values in this set are referred as the "high CMC" $\theta$ values as they have a relatively high number of associated potential CMCs. \citet{tong_improved_2015} propose the following:

> Conduct both forward and backward correlations at each rotation and record the registration based on CCF$_{\max}$, $x$, and $y$ for each cell at each rotation. These data will be used in the next two steps separately.

> At every rotation angle, each cell in the reference image finds a registration position in the compared image with a maximum CCF value. By selecting the registration with the maximum CCF value for each cell, the two CMC numbers determined by the four thresholds can be obtained based on the original algorithm [\citet{tong_fired_2014}]. The lower CMC number is used as the initial result.

> Build CMC-$\theta$ distributions using the data generated in step 1, by counting the number of cells that have congruent positions at each individual rotation angle. Calculate the angular range of “high CMCs” using both the forward and backward CMC-$\theta$ distributions, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.

> If the angular range of the “high CMCs” is within the range $T_\theta$, identify the CMCs for each rotation angle in this range and combine them to give the number of CMCs for this comparison in place of the original CMC number. In this step, if the range is narrower than $T_\theta$, the nearby angles are included to make the range equal to $T_\theta$; CMCs with same index in each rotation are only counted once.

\jz{If the angular range is within $T_\theta$, we say that the cartridge case pair "passes" the High CMC criteria. Otherwise, the pair "fails" the High CMC criteria and the original CMC number used.}

The "prominent peak" observation upon which the High CMC method is based does seem to hold for many known match and known non-match pairs in our experience.
However, we've observed that the behavior of the CMC-$\theta$ distributions depend heavily on the preprocessing procedures used and thresholds set. 
In particular, the CMC-$\theta$ distributions for some KNM pairs exhibit the prominent peak behavior for a wide range of threshold values making them difficult to distinguish from KM pairs.

### Implementation of decision rules {#decisionRuleImplementation}

<!-- \svp{XXX this is a bit abrupt, can you transition into the implementation a bit more gently? Make the point that the parameters described above are included as parameters, and thus, we defer the determination of what the values of those parameters should be until the next section?} -->

\jz{In this section, we demonstrate our implementation of the decision rules applied in the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC method of \citet{tong_improved_2015}.
For illustrative purposes, we consider a particular set of $T_x, T_y, T_{\theta}, T_{\text{CCF}}$ values.
A discussion of how to actually determine thresholds is provided in the} [investigation](#investigation) \jz{section}.

\jz{The steps of the decision rule stage are implemented via the \code{decision\_*} functions. In particular, the \code{decision\_CMC} function applies both the decision rule of the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC method depending on whether the user provides a value for $\tau$, the constant used to define "high" CMC values in the CMC-$\theta$ distribution. The code below demonstrates how the \code{decision\_CMC} can be used within a \code{mutate} call to add columns to the \code{kmComparisonFeatures} data frame. We also compute the CMCs under both decision rules for the \code{kmComparisonFeatures\_rev} data frame consisting of the similarity features for the comparison in which Fadul 1-2 is the reference scan. All 3 stages of the CMC method are also repeated for the comparison between the non-match pair Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 2-1 (not shown to avoid redundancy).}

<!-- \svp{We should have a single function that can do both decisions, `decision_CMC`, with a method argument and an optional parameter `tau`. Also, it would be better to leverage `mutate` rather than having an argument for the column name... more flexible.} -->

The \code{cmcPlot} function can be used to visualize CMCs and non-CMCs. 
\jz{\autoref{fig:topVoteCMCPlot} shows the CMCs and non-CMCs determined under the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} in blue and red, respectively.
The non-CMCs are visualized where they attain the maximum CCF value in the target scan.
The top row shows 17 CMCs in blue and 10 non-CMCs in red when Fadul 1-1 is treated as the reference and Fadul 1-2 the target.
The bottom row shows the 18 CMCs and 14 non-CMCs when the roles are reversed.
There is no discussion in \citet{song_proposed_2013} about combining the results from these two comparison directions, but \citet{tong_improved_2015} propose using the minimum of the two CMC counts (17 in this example).}

Similarly, CMCs and non-CMCs determined under the High CMC method are shown in \autoref{fig:highCMCPlot}.
\jz{Treating Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 1-2 as the reference scan yields 19 and 18 CMCs, respectively.

In contrast, \autoref{fig:knmCMCPlot} shows the CMC results for a comparison between Fadul 1-1 and a known non-match scan, Fadul 2-1, under the exact same processing conditions.
\jz{Only 1 cell was classified as a CMC treating Fadul 1-1 as the reference scan under the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013}. 0 cells were classified as CMCs in the other direction.

## Ambiguities algorithmic descriptions {#ambiguities}

<!-- \svp{This section needs to serve as a transition between the method and the investigation - summarizing the holes we've discovered in the descriptions and moving towards a resolution of those holes through brute-force investigation.} -->

\jz{In this section we summarize the ambiguities identified in the original descriptions of the CMC methods. 
In the following section we investigate ways in which such ambiguities can be rectified by exploring a set of reproducibility principles.}

\jz{It is important to note that much of what we have presented as "the CMC method" might not be considered as such by the original authors. 
In particular, other authors might distinguish proposed methods based only on how their decision rules differ.
We include the preprocessing and cell-based comparison procedures as part of the CMC methodology to emphasize how dependent the final results are on decisions made in these first two steps.
We have only come to this realization after considerable experimentation with and tweaking of our implementation.
The preprocessing and cell-based comparison procedures are discussed only briefly, if at all \citep{tong_improved_2015}, in the CMC literature, yet the results reported often indicate a sensitivity to these procedures.
An actual sensitivity analysis of proposed CMC methods has yet to be published.
Instead, such an analysis seems to be done internally and only promising results are reported.
Left unchecked, this can lead to results that are difficult to generalize to new data.
}

\jz{Apart from the CMC methods' generalizability, we also simply do not know how the proposed methods are implemented. 
Ambiguities in the methods range from minor implicit parameter choices (e.g., the convergence criteria for the robust Gaussian regression filter \citep{brinkman_bodschwinna_2003}) to procedures that fundamentally change how similarity features are extracted and compared (e.g., how the cross-correlation is calculated).
As discussed in the} [introduction](#intro), \jz{this is an issue that pervades computational research for which only prosaic descriptions of algorithms are provided.}
\jz{The only solution to such ambiguity is to enumerate, implement, and pare-down the possible choices that could have been made to arrive to published results.
Unsurprisingly, this process takes a considerable amount of time and resources that would be better spent furthering the state of the field.}

\jz{In the next section, we describe the process of resolving these ambiguities in the CMC method descriptions. In doing so, we abstract a set of principles by which methods and results can be rendered both computationally reproducible and more thoroughly understood.}

# Investigation of cell-based forensic pattern matching methods {#investigation}

As described in the [initial data](#initialData) section, the set of cartridge case scans from \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate} is commonly used to compare the performance of various methods in the CMC literature. 
This set consists of 40 cartridge cases; 63 known match pairs and 717 known non-match pairs. 
While the exact procedures by which these scans are processed are unavailable, the surface data are openly available in their raw, unprocessed format NIST Ballistics Toolmark Research Database.
Thus, some level of comparison between the implementation provided in the \pkg{cmcR} package and published results is possible.
However, justification for any differences will ultimately involve educated hypothesization due to the closed-source nature of the original implementations.

For any cartridge case pair, the number of CMCs can be determined under the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC method described in [implementation](#implementation) section.
\jz{We have applied our implementation of these two methods to the} 780 cartridge case pairs available in the \citet{fadul_empirical_nodate} data set \jz{under a wide variety of processing conditions to determine which conditions yield perfect identification}.
Perfect identification of all matching and non-matching pairs corresponds to choosing a minimum CMC count threshold that separates the distributions of the matching and non-matching CMC counts. 
Many authors have found success in choosing a CMC count threshold of 6 CMCs [\citet{tong_improved_2015}, \citet{song_estimating_2018}] as initially proposed by \citet{song_proposed_2013}, although this threshold has been shown to not generalize well to all proposed methods or cartridge case data sets \citep{chen_convergence_2017}.
In this section, we will investigate how ambiguities identified in the [CMC method descriptions](cmcMethod) induce a high degree of sensitivity to choosing the "correct" processing conditions.
A sensitivity analysis of the original method \jz{of \citet{song_proposed_2013}} and its descendants has yet to be published. 
As previously discussed, the conditions under which these proposed methods are applied differ considerably across papers making it difficult to compare results. 
We hope to partly remedy this problem by providing a discussion of the sensitivity of the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} and the High CMC method.
While the presentation provided here is far from exhaustive, we focus this discussion on what we have found to be highly influential factors on the methods' sensitivity.
These factors include sensitivity to the choice of congruency thresholds, to the reader's interpretation of the methods' descriptions, and to the preprocessing procedures employed before feature-extraction. \jz{In identifying these influential factors, we also propose a set of principles applicable to any type of computationally reproducible research. We argue that adherence to these principles yields not only reproducible results, but also greater clarity of a proposed method.}

## Communicating a method's sensitivity to processing conditions

\jz{One of these influential factors is the choice of $T_x, T_y, T_\theta, T_{\text{CCF}}$ thresholds use to declare a particular cell/region pair "congruent." 
Many combinations of these thresholds yield perfect separation between the matching and non-matching CMC count distributions. 
As such, some other diagnostic must be used to compare different sets of thresholds.
Considering that ground-truth is known for the Fadul data set, we will obtain a group of known match CMC counts and a group of known non-match CMC counts for each set of thresholds. 
A simple diagnostic based on this observation is a ratio that compares the between- and within-group variability.
Let CMC$_{i,j}$ denote the CMC count assigned to the $j$th cartridge case pair, $j = 1,...,n_i$, $n_1 = 63, n_2 = 717$, from the $i$th group, $i = 1,2$ representing matches and non-matches, respectively. 
For each set of thresholds we calculate}
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2 \left(\overline{\text{CMC}}_{i} - \overline{\text{CMC}}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{1}{n_i - 1}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \left(\text{CMC}_{i,j} - \overline{\text{CMC}}_i\right)^2}
$$
\jz{where $\overline{\text{CMC}}_i$ denotes the within-group CMC count average and $\overline{\text{CMC}}$ denotes the grand CMC count average. 
Greater separation between and less variability within the match and non-match CMC count distributions will yield larger $r$ values. 
As such, larger values of $r$ are preferred.}

\jz{As an example, \autoref{fig:decisionRuleSensitivity_comparison} compares the CMC results using the original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} vs. the High CMC method where $T_{\Delta x} = 20 = T_{\Delta y}$ pixels, $T_{\text{CCF}} = .5$, and $T_{\theta} = 6$ degrees. 
We can see that both decision rules result in separated (i.e., non-overlapping) CMC count distributions. 
However, the High CMC decision rule yields more appealing separation between the match and non-match distribution as evidenced by the considerably larger variance ratio. 
These results are, of course, dependent on many other processing decisions than just the threshold values used, so a greater sensitivity analysis should be considered.}

We consider five parameter settings that, based on our experimentation, have a demonstrable impact on the effectiveness of the CMC method. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item the decision rule (original method of \citet{song_proposed_2013} or High CMC method of \citet{tong_improved_2015}) used,

\item whether the global trend is removed during preprocessing, and

\item choice of congruency thresholds: translation $T_x, T_y$, rotation $T_\theta$, and CCF $T_{\text{CCF}}$.
\end{itemize}
To understand the generalizability of a particular set of parameters to "out-of-sample" data, choosing parameter settings resulting in an AUC equal to 1 (perfect identification) is not enough. 
Instead, we use the variance ratio to identify a promising range of thresholds. \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} shows the value of the variance ratio under various settings of these 5 parameters. 
We can see that using the High CMC method on breech face scans for which the trend was removed yields better variance ratio values. 
Conditional on these settings, choosing thresholds $T_x, T_y \in [15,20]$, $T_\theta = 6$, and $T_{\text{CCF}} \in [.4,5]$ yields arguably the most promising variance ratios. 
These are similar thresholds to those chosen in other CMC papers.

\jz{There are other conclusions that we can draw from \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} that connect to what we have discussed previously as patterns in the CMC literature that make reproducibility impossible. 
In particular, \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} illustrates the dangers of providing a written-word description of an algorithm in which, for example, the removal of a global data trend is not explicitly considered.
Additionally, we can see the benefits of breaking a method up into modularized steps to uncover flaws or sensitivities.
We will expand upon this below.}

## Exploring algorithmic ambiguities through modularization {#exploring}

\jz{Changes to the preprocessing procedures have major impact on the effectiveness of the CMC method. 
For example, consider a change to the procedure described in the} [preprocessing](#preProcessing) \jz{section in which surface matrices are not leveled before applying the bandpass Gaussian filter (i.e., skipping step (3) shown in \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}). 
Recall that this step is performed in our implementation due to the trends in height values exhibited frequently yet inconsistently across cartridge cases fired from the same firearm. 
No explicit reference is given for how these trends are handled in the CMC literature, although a Gaussian regression filter would implicitly attenuate their effects.}

\jz{\autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} shows the results for both decision rules where the surface matrices were not leveled prior to applying the bandpass Gaussian filter. 
We can see that the variance ratios are considerably worse, indicating less separation between the match and non-match CMC count distributions, when surface matrices' trends aren't removed.
In particular, we have observed that non-matching cartridge case pairs with similar trends may be assigned more "false-positive" CMCs while, conversely, matching pairs with dissimilar trends are assigned fewer CMCs.
This emphasizes how dangerous it can be to take the preprocessing procedures for granted.}

\jz{As another example, unintentional ambiguities in written-language description of the High CMC method lead to different interpretations of its decision rule}.
[Recall that](#highCMCMethod) \jz{the last step of the High CMC method is to combine CMCs from the two comparison directions, assuming that the High CMC criteria were satisfied.
A common occurrence we have found in our experimentation is that one comparison direction satisfies the High CMC criteria while the other does not.
Based on the description provided in \citet{tong_improved_2015} (which we've quoted in the} [High CMC decision rule section](#highCMCMethod))\jz{, it is unclear how to handle such situations.
The convention adopted in \pkg{cmcR} is to require that both directions satisfy the High CMC criteria in order to combine their results (otherwise, the CMCs determined under the original method \citet{song_proposed_2013} are used).
However, other interpretations of the decision rule could certainly be considered.}

\jz{This illustrates how a prosaic description of an algorithm is generally insufficient to properly implement the method. Even precise algorithmic descriptions typically gloss-over the usage of particular programming languages, functions, or parameter settings. 
Algorithms that theoretically should be consistent across implementations may in-practice yield numerical inconsistencies due to factors that would require the authors' careful consideration to make consistent. 
For example, how different programming languages handle various datatypes (floating-point, complex numbers, etc.) or how random seeds are used to initialize pseudorandom number generators. 
Because of this, anything short of providing the code and data used to produce published results renders computational reproduction challenging if not impossible.}

\jz{Dividing a method into a modularized "pipeline" of exchangeable steps as is done in \pkg{cmcR} makes it easier to explore the sensitivities and deficiencies of a method.
Further, results and scientific insights are more transparent compared to "black box" or close-source methods.
For example, skipping the de-trending step of the preprocessing procedure is as simple as commenting-out a few lines of code.
The authors of the various CMC methods already have some form of this modularization, as evidenced by the slight differences in procedures across the CMC literature. 
However, there has yet to be a consolidation of the various procedures used into an "optimal" processing pipeline. 
Perhaps a more principled approach cast as an optimization problem is required rather than an experimental approach. The structure provided by \pkg{cmcR} package certainly makes it easier to explore such alternatives.}

# Conclusion {#conclusion}

The results shared in this manuscript indicate that the implementation of the CMC method in the \pkg{cmcR} package is qualitatively similar to those in the CMC literature. 
As such methods could potentially be used in the future as evidence to support legal conclusions, it is imperative that specific implementations be openly available for assessment and validation. 
Furthermore, reproducibility of results hinges on automating as much of the comparison process as possible. 
We have discussed the ways in which the prosaic descriptions of CMC procedures fail to adequately detail implementations that yield reproducible results. 
Ambiguity in the implementation stems mainly from implicit parameters and processing choices in the written-language descriptions. 
While admissible from a readability perspective, anything short of making the original code available renders published results not reproducible. 
This is compounded by the fact that a critical preprocessing step is performed manually and that preprocessed data are not publicly available.

\svp{At one time, it was common to publish the specific implementation of an algorithm as raw source code \citep{bron_merge_1972} within the journal article (or at minimum, in the appendix \citep{friend_sorting_1956} if the article contained a significant amount of analysis). 
While it is still relatively common to provide access to a github repository or other repository for source code, these repositories are not guaranteed to exist in perpetuity; certainly, when compared to \citep{bron_merge_1972}, the likelihood of being able to find the source code for an article is higher when the code is included in the article or made readily accessible in another format. 
In many cases, though, authors do not make their code available for analysis; this provides a substantial hurdle when attempting to use, replicate, or compare the published method and represents a significant barrier to scientific progress. 
Unfortunately, a pure `re-implementation' of existing work generally does not count as research, which does not encourage to build on one another's work nor compare across approaches from different research groups.}
Re-implementations often require enumerating and implementing a wide variety of processing options, likely larger than the scope of the original implementation, and yield a deeper understanding of a method's proficiency \citep{Stodden2013SettingTD}. 
The process by which the CMC method was implemented in the \pkg{cmcR} package testifies to how important the recent push for open-source development is to scientific progress.

<!-- Lastly, it is simply best academic practice to be transparent about how certain results were obtained and how sensitive these results are to different processing conditions. The \pkg{cmcR} package is intended to provide researchers with an automatic, transparent tool to further explore the potential of the CMC method and develop novel techniques to perform firearm evidence identification. -->

<!-- Future changes to the current implementation will likely come in the form of improvements to the way that breech face impressions are automatically isolated and highlighted within the scan. Additionally, there are also a number of other extensions to the initially proposed CMC method that currently lack an open-source implementation. The foundation set by the \pkg{cmcR} package should make it easier to implement these extensions in the future.  -->
