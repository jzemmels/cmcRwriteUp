abstract: > 
  Scientific research is driven by our ability to use methods, procedures, and materials from previous studies and further this research by adding to it. As the need for computationally-intensive methods to analyze large amounts of data grows, the criteria needed to achieve reproducibility, specifically computational reproducibility, have become more sophisticated. In general, prosaic descriptions of algorithms are not detailed or precise enough to ensure complete reproducibility of a method. Results may be sensitive to conditions not commonly specified in written-word descriptions such as implicit parameter settings or the programming language used. To achieve true computational reproducibility, it is necessary to provide all intermediate data and code used to produce published results. In this paper, we consider a class of algorithms developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to perform firearm evidence identification on cartridge case evidence known as the \dfn{Congruent Matching Cells} (CMC) methods. To date, only textual descriptions of these algorithms have been published. We introduce the first open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells methods in the R package \CRANpkg{cmcR}. We have structured the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package as a set of sequential, modularized functions intended to ease the process of parameter experimentation. We use \CRANpkg{cmcR} and a novel variance ratio statistic to explore the CMC methodology and illustrate problems that arise when  computationally ambiguous algorithms descriptions   are provided.

# Introduction {#intro}

<!--\jz{Paragraph 1: Discuss need for forensic pattern-matching algorithms in general. Discuss how some algorithms have been developed open-source [cite CSAFE], yet many haven't.}-->

Forensic examinations are intended to provide an objective assessment of the probative value of a piece of evidence.
Typically, this assessment of probative value is performed by a forensic examiner who visually inspects the evidence to determine whether, for example, it matches evidence found on a suspect.
The process by which an examiner arrives to their evidentiary conclusion is largely opaque  and has been criticized \citepalias{pcast} for its subjective manner which also does not allow for an estimation of error rates.
In response, the \citet{council_strengthening_2009} has pushed to complement subjective decisions made by forensic examiners with automatic algorithms that objectively assess evidence and can be explained during court testimony.
Various pattern-matching methods have been proposed to objectively measure the similarity between two pieces of evidence.
However, only a fraction of these proposed methods have an open-source, auditable implementation for specific types of evidence; for example, glass \citep{park2019}, handwriting \citep{crawford_handwriting_2020}, shoe prints \citep{park_algorithm_2020}, and ballistic evidence \citep{hare_automatic_2016,tai_fully_2018}.
In high-stakes fields like forensics, where it is necessary that a method's strengths and weaknesses are well-understood by practitioners, \hh{ the legal and forensic communities as well as, ideally, the interested public at-large}, open-source algorithms provide a transparency that manufacturers of proprietary algorithms cannot or will not provide.
In particular, open-source algorithms \hh{allow and enable} the  scientific community to explore a method's sensitivity to processing or parameter choices.
Such an exploration is needed to reach a consensus on reasonable settings to use in-practice.
In the absence of a general consensus, it is plausible that the prosecution and defense could each choose a set of parameters and arrive at conflicting results.
This is not a desirable outcome as it completely contradicts the objective fact-finding mission of a forensic examination.

<!--\jz{Paragraph 1a: Keep discussion broad. Cite Daubert and argue that "immediate, exact" computational reproducibility is required to obtain an error rate as opposed to "eventual, qualitative" reproducibility.}-->

The 1993 Supreme Court case \citetalias{daubert} established the ``Daubert Standard" which requires that a scientific method have a known error rate and be widely accepted by a relevant scientific community before it can be used in an expert witness's testimony.
To achieve this standard for forensic pattern-matching algorithms, we need to be able to unambiguously reproduce the results of the algorithm.
\dfn{Reproducibility} refers to the ability to use the same procedures and materials as a previous study to arrive at the same results or conclusions.
Unfortunately, we cannot take reproducibility for granted: recent studies have raised concerns about reproducibility of scientific findings in various fields \citep{king_replication_1995,baker_1500_2016,pasquier_if_2017}.
\jz{While a reproduction of results by the original research group is the bare minimum to achieve scientific rigor, it is not particularly helpful in consequential fields like forensic science where reproduction of results by other research groups or practitioners is important.}
In computational research, reproducibility of results is commonly translated to mean that the code and data used to produce published results be made publicly available \citep{peng_reproducible_2011}.
<!-- \hh{XXX we also need to talk about 'who is able to reproduce' - reproducibility of research by the research group who published the finding should be considered a minimum of scientific rigor, but it is not particularly helpful in a high-stakes field such as forensic science.} -->
Computational reproducibility requires more details: published results may be numerically sensitive to the particular implementation of a computational method, including such considerations as data processing decisions, parameter settings, and even the chosen programming language.
In this light, computational reproducibility in forensic science is all the more important because it enables discussions about algorithmic transparency and accountability \citep{kwongAlgorithmSaysYou2017, desaiTrustVerifyGuide2017}.
Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the forensic community does not go only halfway, trading a subjective, human black box for objective, proprietary algorithms that are similarly opaque and unauditable.
As a community, we need to develop our algorithms from the ground up with the intention that any results be immediately computationally reproducible by \jz{interested parties, such as another research group,} rather than eventually qualitatively reproducible.

<!--\jz{Paragraph 2: narrow focus to cartridge case comparisons. Define breech face markings, etc. Also include comparison microscope image.}-->

In this paper, we focus on cartridge case comparison algorithms. A \dfn{cartridge case} is the portion of firearm ammunition that encases a projectile (e.g., bullet, shots, or slug) along with the explosive used to propel the projectile through the firearm.
When a firearm is discharged, the projectile is propelled down the barrel of the firearm, while the cartridge case is forced towards the back of the barrel.
It strikes the back wall, known as the \dfn{breech face}, of the barrel with considerable force, thereby imprinting any markings on the breech face onto the cartridge case and creating the so-called \dfn{breech face impressions}.
These markings have been suggested to be unique to a firearm and are used in forensic examinations to determine whether two cartridge cases have been fired by the same firearm.
During a forensic examination, two pieces of ballistic evidence are placed under a \dfn{comparison microscope}.
Comparison microscopes allow for a side-by-side comparison of two objects within the same viewfinder, as seen in \autoref{fig:ccPair_combined}.
A pair of breech face images is aligned along the thin black line in the middle of the images.
The degree to which these breech face markings can be aligned is used to determine whether the two cartridge cases came from the same source; i.e., were fired from the same firearm.
These breech face impressions are considered to be a firearm's unique "fingerprint" left on a cartridge case \citep{firearm_id_thompson}.

```{r ,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='\\label{fig:ccPair_combined} A cartridge case pair with visible breech face impressions under a microscrope.  A thin line can be seen separating the two views. The degree to which the markings coincide is used to conclude whether the pair comes from the same source.',fig.pos='htbp',out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cartridgeCasePair_comparison_with_line.PNG")
```

\jz{To clarify language used in the remainder of the paper, we now define a (non-exhaustive) \dfn{hierarchy of algorithmic transparency} meant to classify different formats in which algorithms are commonly presented.
Ascending this hierarchy results in more transparent algorithms in the sense that it is easier to computationally reproduce results derived from an algorithm presented in the associated format.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \jz{\dfn{conceptual description}: the ``big-picture" of an algorithm and is most often presented in the form of prose or a diagram.}

\item \jz{\dfn{pseudocode}: provides more algorithmic structure than conceptual descriptions and often highlights important subroutines or even parameter settings used in an algorithm.}

\item \jz{\dfn{open-source}: an algorithm's source code is available on a public code repository like CRAN or GitHub.}
\end{enumerate}

\jz{Ancillary to this hierarchy and necessary to ensure computational reproducibility is the availability of the data used to produce the original results.
In particular, we consider it important to draw a distinction here between raw and processed data.
For cartridge case comparison algorithms, cartridge case images are often manually preprocessed by practitioners to isolate what they consider to be the breech face impression region.
This implies that the data to which an algorithm is applied is effectively unique to the individual who is processing the data.}

<!-- \jz{Paragraph 3: Introduce problem that the paper addresses. "The CMC algorithm has been only introduced conceptually..." Briefly touch on issues of reproducibility.} -->

The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) \jz{pipeline is a collection of algorithms developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2012 to process and compare cartridge case evidence \citep{song_proposed_2013}.}
Since then, the pipeline and its numerous extensions \citep{tong_improved_2015,chen_convergence_2017,song_estimating_2018} have shown promise in being able to differentiate between matching and non-matching cartridge cases.
However, so far the CMC \jz{pipelines} have only been introduced conceptually in the form of written-word descriptions.
\jz{Further, the cartridge case scans used to validate the pipelines are only available in their raw, unprocessed forms on the NIST Ballistics Research Database \citep{nbtrd}.
While it is clear that the creators of the CMC pipeline have a working implementation, the wider forensic science community only has access to conceptual descriptions of the pipeline and some summary statistics describing its performance.}

\jz{Here, we describe the process of implementing the CMC pipeline for the comparison of marks on spent cartridge cases, using the descriptions from two published papers, \citet{song_3d_2014} and \citet{tong_improved_2015}.
Our R package, \CRANpkg{cmcR}, provides an open-source implementation of the CMC pipeline.
We use \CRANpkg{cmcR} to illustrate how ambiguities in the textual description of an algorithm can lead to highly divergent results.
In particular, our implementation highlights an extreme sensitivity to processing and parameter decisions that has not been discussed previously.
Additionally, we argue that our implementation can be used as a template for future implementations of forensic pattern-matching algorithms to not only ensure transparency and auditability, but also to ease experimentation and improvement.}

In the remainder of this paper, we first describe some of the background of forensic comparisons of breech face impressions.
We then follow with a description of the implementation of a general CMC pipeline which encompasses \jz{those} discussed in \citet{song_proposed_2013}, \citet{song_3d_2014}, and \citet{tong_improved_2015}.
\citet{song_proposed_2013} lays out the conceptual framework for the original CMC pipeline later implemented in \citet{song_3d_2014} and \citet{tong_fired_2014}.
An improvement of the pipeline presented in \citet{tong_improved_2015} and used in subsequent papers is referred to as the \`\`High CMC" method \citep{chen_convergence_2017}.
\jz{However, it should be noted that what the authors refer to as the original and High CMC decision rules are variations of one step of a larger CMC pipeline.
As will become clear below, we will refer to these variations as the original and High CMC "decision rules" from here on.}
Both \jz{decision rules} (and other proposed \jz{variations}) have been shown to correctly differentiate same and different-source cartridge cases from the \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} data set.
The \CRANpkg{cmcR} package contains implementations designed for use with 3D topographical scans of the original decision rule described in \citet{song_proposed_2013} and \citet{song_3d_2014} and the High CMC decision rule described in \citet{tong_improved_2015}.
The source code to the full \CRANpkg{cmcR} package is accessible at <https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/cmcR>.

# The CMC pipeline {#cmcMethod}

In this section, we examine the process of implementing the CMC pipeline for automatic comparisons of 3D cartridge case scans. At each step, we will compare the description in the published papers with the implementation in code, discussing the gaps in the pipeline description and how we filled in those gaps during the creation of \CRANpkg{cmcR}. We discuss each stage of the CMC pipeline using excerpts from the original papers. Then, we examine the implementation of each sub-procedure in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package, considering the differences between the textual description and its algorithmic translation.

All of the CMC pipelines can be broken down into three broad stages: (1) preprocessing, (2) cell-based similarity feature extraction, and (3) application of a decision rule as illustrated in \autoref{fig:overview-flow}. In the following sections we break each of these stages further into a set of modular steps. One advantage of modularizing these algorithms is that we can implement an algorithm as a set of sequential procedures. This allows us to test new variations against the old implementation in a coherent, unified framework.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/overview-flow.png}
\caption{The stages of CMC pipelines. In the preprocessing stage, each scan is prepared for analysis, removing extraneous information and noise. Then, each scan is broken up into cells, which are numerically compared to cells in the other scan to determine an optimal alignment. Finally, each of the scores arising from the cells in the second stage are compared to a reference distribution to determine whether the scans originate from the same source or from different sources.\label{fig:overview-flow}}
\end{figure}
```

The primary difference between the two pipelines presented here, the original and High CMC decision rules, lies in how the decision rules are utilized to separate matches and non-matches. Beyond that there are also several small differences in the parameters used in the preprocessing and comparison procedures. \jz{Despite using the same validation data from \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} across papers, current authors do not provide justification for changing these parameters.} \jz{At the same time, different conditions have been shown to yield very different results; even when applying the same decision rule. This sensitivity of various pipelines to different conditions has not previously been discussed in detail.}

## Initial Data {#initialData}

Digital microscopy is capable of precision measurements of surface topology at even higher resolutions. Using a 3D microscope, we can obtain scans of breech face impressions at the micron level ($1 \mu m = 10^{-3} mm = 10^{-6} m$). These 3D topological scans are used as input to automated comparison algorithms, such as the CMC pipeline originally proposed in \citet{song_proposed_2013}.} We will use the same data set which is referenced in \citet{song_3d_2014} and \citet{tong_improved_2015} to illustrate usage of the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package. These 3D scans of cartridge cases are available from the NIST Ballistics Toolmark Research Database \citep[NBTRD;][]{nbtrd}. The strings defined below refer to three cartridge case scans available on the NBTRD from \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} and will be used throughout the remainder of this paper.

             })
```

Cartridge case scans are commonly stored in the ISO standard x3p file format \citep{ISO25178-72}. x3p is a container format which consists of a single surface matrix representing the height value of the breech face surface and metadata concerning the parameters under which the scan was taken (size, resolution, creator, microscope, and microscopy software versions etc.). The \CRANpkg{x3ptools} package \citep{x3ptools} provides functionality to work with the format in R.

\autoref{fig:cartridgeCasePair} shows the surface matrices of a known match (KM) pair of cartridge cases from a study by \citet{fadul_empirical_2011}. In this study, a total of 40 cartridge cases were scanned with a lateral resolution of 6.25 microns (micrometers) per pixel. The surface matrices are approximately $1200 \times 1200$ pixels in size corresponding to an area of about $3.8 \times 3.8$ mm$^2$.

Only certain regions of a cartridge case contain identifying breech face impression markings. \citet{song_proposed_2013} defines "valid correlation regions" as regions where "the individual characteristics of the ballistics signature are found that can be used effectively for ballistics identification." Prior to applying the CMC comparison procedure, cartridge scans must undergo some preprocessing to identify these valid correlation regions.

## Preprocessing procedures {#preProcessing}

During the preprocessing stage, a series of sequential steps is used to prepare each cartridge case for analysis. The goal of this process is to remove the edges and center of the scan which did not come into contact with the breech face, as well as any artifacts of the scan and microscope staging which do not accurately represent the breech face surface.

The different iterations of the CMC algorithm describe different variations of these steps. A summary of these steps is shown in \autoref{fig:preprocessing-schematic}.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/preprocessing_flow.png}
\caption{Overview of the set of pre-processing steps used in the CMC algorithms. Where a procedure step is not discussed or explicitly not applied in the paper, the path traverses empty space.}\label{fig:preprocessing-schematic}
\end{figure}
```
The implementation in \citet{tong_fired_2014} describes the preprocessing steps (for the 2D images) as:

> After trimming processing [sic] to remove unrelated correlations areas, the final image size is reduced to 700 × 700 pixel with an estimated pixel spacing of 5.0 $\mu$m. A Gaussian smoothing filter (standard deviation $\sigma$ = 1) was implemented first to remove high frequency noise.

<!-- Complicating the issue of preprocessing the scans, the procedures used to process the surface matrices differ in each of the papers discussed here.  -->
\citet{song_3d_2014} outline the following preprocessing procedure on 3D scans:

> Trim off the inside firing pin surface and other areas outside the breech face mark, so that only breech face impression data remain for correlation.

> Identify and remove dropouts or outliers.

> Apply a band-pass Gaussian regression filter with 40 $\mu$m short cutoff length and 400 $\mu$m long cutoff length to remove low frequency components, including surface curvature, form error, waviness and high frequency components which mainly arise from the instrument noise.

While not explicitly mentioned in \citet{song_3d_2014}, \citet{song_estimating_2018} indicates that the "trimming" of the unwanted regions of the scan is performed manually. No further information is given in the paper describing what criteria were used for this process; nor are the trimmed scans provided as intermediate data for the sake of reproducibility.

It is also unclear how the dropouts and outliers are "removed" from the scan or even how outliers are defined; many different methods for outlier detection and removal are used in surface metrology \citep{outlierdetection}. Most of these algorithms require the user to select thresholds or parameters; thus, without any details about how the outlier detection process was implemented, this portion of \citet{song_3d_2014} is not reproducible.

We are not aware of an open-source implementation of the multivariate band-pass Gaussian regression filter used in surface metrology \citep{ISO16610-71}. Further, there are various parameters requiring specification to implement a Gaussian regression filter and it is not clear how these parameters were chosen \citep{brinkman_bodschwinna_2003}.

As a result of these ambiguities, during our implementation of the preprocessing algorithm, we had to make several educated guesses in order to match the described procedure (and reported results) as closely as possible.

### Implementation of preprocessing procedures

The preprocessing procedures are implemented via modularized functions of the form \code{preProcess\_*}. Modularizing the steps of the preprocessing procedures makes the overall process easier to understand and allows for experimentation. \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows an overview of the preprocessing framework for the Fadul 1-1 breech face from reading the scan (left) to an analysis-ready region (right)}. For each scan in \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}, eleven height value percentiles: the Minimum (0th), 1st, 2.5th, 10th, 25th, Median (50th), 75th, 90th, 97.5th, 99th, and Maximum (100th) are mapped to a purple-to-orange color gradient. This mapping is chosen to highlight the extreme values in each scan.

We demonstrate usage of the \code{preProcess\_*} functions on the Fadul 1-1 scan. Each code chunk is followed up with an explanation of the functions used.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (1)
fadul1.1 <- x3ptools::x3p_read("data/fadul1-1.x3p")
```

We begin with a 3D scan. Typically, scans are downsampled to about 25% of their size by only retaining every other row and column in the surface matrix. The breech faces in \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} were initially scanned at a resolution of 3.125 $\mu$m per pixel. Downsampling reduces the resolution to 6.25 $\mu$m per pixel. Step (1) in \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows an unprocessed breech face scan.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (2)
fadul1.1_cropped <- fadul1.1 %>%
  cmcR::preProcess_crop(region = "exterior") %>%
  cmcR::preProcess_crop(region = "interior")
```

Three major regions of the scan are identified via a labeling algorithm as described in \citet{hesselink_concurrent_2001} and available in the \CRANpkg{imager} package \citep{imager}. These regions are the circle capturing the exterior of the cartridge case primer, the breech face impression region, and the circle around the firing pin impression hole in the center of the scan.

The goal is to isolate the breech face impression region by removing (i.e., replacing with \code{NA}) the pixels in the other two regions. Upon labeling the different regions of the cartridge case scan, the centers and radii of the cartridge case primer and firing pin impression hole are estimated. This estimation procedure may require some user input depending on how much of the exterior/interior the user wants removed. The resulting breech face scan, like the one shown in step (2) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}, is reproducible assuming the same user-specified settings are used. The \code{preProcess\_crop} function removes the exterior and firing pin impression region on the interior based on the \code{region} argument.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (3)
fadul1.1_deTrended <- fadul1.1_cropped %>%
  preProcess_removeTrend(statistic = "quantile", tau = .5, method = "fn")
```

In step (3) any existing large-scale trend in the breech face scan height values are removed. In steps (1) and (2) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} it is clear that there is a southwest-to-northeast trend in height values. Such a trend is observable in many cartridge case scans, yet does not occur consistently across cartridge cases fired from the same firearm. This indicates that a trend in height values is likely to be an artifact of the scanning process resulting from cartridge cases not being precisely, horizontally leveled prior to taking the scan. Neglecting to remove these trends leads to very different results based on our implementation. In an extreme situation, two different-source cartridge cases with similar trends might be incorrectly deemed "congruent." The \code{preProcess\_removeTrend} functions levels the breech face impression regions obtained from step (2). The function estimates and subtracts the conditional median via a quantile regression as implemented in the \code{rq} function of the \CRANpkg{quantreg} package \citep{quantreg}. Step (3) of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline} shows a median-leveled breech face scan.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Step (4)
fadul1.1_processed <- fadul1.1_deTrended %>%
  preProcess_gaussFilter(filtertype = "bp", wavelength = c(16,500)) %>%
  x3ptools::x3p_sample(m = 2)
```

In the final preprocessing step, a band-pass filter is applied to the processed breech face scan to reduce the effects of undesired frequencies in the comparison procedure. For example, low frequency (large wavelength) global structure may exist in a cartridge case scan due to manufacturing specifications. In forensics, this type of structure is referred to as a class or subclass characteristic -- it is shared by many objects of the same make and model. Class characteristics are used by forensic practitioners to initially pare down the possible pool of matching cartridge cases \citep{firearm_id_thompson}. While this additional global structure may assist with matching cartridge cases, it can also artificially inflate the similarity between truly non-matching scans. The goal of comparing breech-face scans is to answer the question of source. \jz{Same-sourceness can only be determined by matching individual characteristics, so the global structure is removed by using a high-pass Gaussian filter.} Similarly, a low-pass filter is used to remove noise and outliers from cartridge case scans due to, for example, imperfections in the scanning process. A band-pass Gaussian filter combines the effects of low and high-pass filters; this is the default choice in \CRANpkg{cmcR}. The band-pass filtered breech face scan as returned by the \code{preProcess\_gaussFilter} function is shown in the fourth panel of \autoref{fig:processingPipeline}.

There is currently no determination or removal of outliers in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package's preprocessing procedures. Instead, we rely on the low-pass portion of the Gaussian filter to reduce the effects of any high-frequency noise.

\autoref{fig:processedScans} displays the processed Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 1-2 scans; the second matrix is processed using the same parameters. Similarity features are extracted from a processed cartridge case pair in the cell-based comparison procedure.

## "Correlation cell" comparison procedure {#comparisonProcedure}

As described in \citet{song_proposed_2013}, breech face markings are not uniformly impressed upon a cartridge case during the firing process. As such, only certain sections of the cartridge case are used in a comparison. In the CMC pipeline as proposed by \citet{song_proposed_2013} two scans are compared by partitioning one breech face scan into a grid of so-called "correlation cells". These cells are compared individually to their best-matching counterpart on the other scan. If a large proportion of these correlation cells are highly similar to their counterparts on the other breech face scan, this is considered as evidence that the markings on the two cartridge cases were made by the same source. The number of highly similar cells is defined as the \dfn{CMC count} $C$ \citep{song_proposed_2013} of the breech-face comparison. The CMC count is considered to be a more robust similarity metric than a cross-correlation score based on the entire cartridge case.

\autoref{fig:cmc_illustration} illustrates the cell-based comparison procedure between two cartridge case scans. The scan on the left serves as the reference; it is divided into a grid of $k \times k$ cells. The cell size (and thus, the corresponding number of cells) is optimized experimentally:

> The cell size must be experimentally optimized, not too small and not too large. Either condition may result in low correlation accuracy. For the initial tests of 9 mm caliber cartridge cases, good correlation results for breech face correlations were obtained using the cell sizes ranging from (0.25 × 0.25) to (0.5 × 0.5) $mm^2$. \citep{song_3d_2014}

Each cell is paired with an associated larger region in the other scan. The absolute location of each cell and region in their respective surface matrices remain constant. However, the scan on the right is rotated to determine the rotation at which the two scans are the most "similar," as quantified by the \dfn{cross-correlation function} (CCF).

For a real-valued matrices $A$ and $B$ of dimension $M \times N$ and $P \times Q$, respectively, the cross-correlation function, denoted $(A \star B)$ is defined as $$
(A \star B)[m,n] = \sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{j=1}^N A[i,j] B[(i + m), (j + n)],
$$ where $-(P-1) \leq m \leq M-1$ and $-(Q-1) \leq n \leq N-1$. By this definition, the $[m,n]$th element of the resulting $M + P - 1 \times N + Q - 1$ CCF matrix quantifies the similarity between matrices $A$ and $B$ for a translation of matrix $B$ by $m$ pixels horizontally and $n$ pixel vertically. The index at which the CCF attains a maximum represents the optimal translation needed to align $B$ with $A$. The CCF as defined need not be bounded between $-1$ and $1$. However, it is common to normalize the CCF for interpretability, and this is the convention adopted by the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package.

Prior to calculating the CCF, the matrices $A$ and $B$ are standardized through subtraction of their respective means and division by their respective standard deviations. This is referred to as the \dfn{Areal Cross-Correlation Function} (ACCF) in some CMC papers \citep{ott_applying_2017}. A direct calculation of the CCF for breech face scans based on the definition above is inhibitingly slow. While computationally feasible alternatives exist, \citet{song_proposed_2013} and other CMC papers do not specify the algorithm used to calculate the CCF.

\jz{\citet{song_3d_2014} describe the comparison process:}

> CMC pairs are identified by three types of identification parameters: the correlation value CCF$_{\max}$, registration angle $\theta$ and translation distances $x$, $y$ with thresholds $T_{\text{CCF}}$, $T_\theta$ and $T_x, T_y$, respectively. The correlated cell pairs are considered as CMCs when their correlation value CCF$_{\max}$, $T_{\text{CCF}}$, and their registration angle $\theta$ and $x-y$ registration pattern are within the thresholds $T_\theta$, and $T_x, T_y$.

Note, that rotating an image or breech face scan by an arbitrary angle (other than a multiple of 90 degrees) requires interpolating new pixel locations. A variety of interpolation schemes exist \citep{parker_comparison_1983}, but there are no details provided in the papers under consideration indicating which interpolation algorithm was used. In \CRANpkg{cmcR}, surfaces matrices are rotated using a "nearest-neighbor" interpolation scheme \citep{imager}.

In the next section, we discuss our implementation of the cell-based comparison procedure.

### Implementation of the correlation cell comparison procedure

All of the steps dealing with cell-based comparisons are implemented as functions of the form \code{comparison\_*}. Similar to the \code{preProcess\_*} functions, the \code{comparison\_*} functions can be chained together through a sequence of pipes.

Published implementations of the CMC algorithm do not describe precisely how the CCF is calculated. In image processing, it is common to use an implementation based on the Fast Fourier Transform \citep{Brown92asurvey}. This implementation leverages the Cross-Correlation Theorem, which states that for matrices $A$ and $B$, the CCF can be expressed in terms of frequency-domain pointwise product: $$
(A \star B )[m,n]= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\overline{\mathcal{F}(A)} \odot \mathcal{F}(B)\right)[m,n]
$$ where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote the discrete Fourier and inverse discrete Fourier transforms, respectively, and $\overline{\mathcal{F}(A)}$ denotes the complex conjugate \citep{fft_brigham}. Because the product on the right-hand side is calculated pointwise, this result allows us to trade the moving sum computations from the definition of the CCF for two forward Fourier transformation, a pointwise product, and an inverse Fourier transformation. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm can be used to reduce the computational load considerably. Our implementation of this FFT-based CCF calculation is adapted from the \pkg{cartridges3D} package \citep{cartridges3D}.

No computational shortcut comes without some tradeoffs, though, and this FFT-based CCF calculation is no different. The FFT does not tolerate missing values, and breech faces are not continuous surfaces -- all of the white regions in \autoref{fig:cmc_illustration} correspond to missing values. While it is unclear how the CCF is implemented in the CMC papers
<!-- (it is not even defined mathematically) -->
, the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package adopts the following conventions:

-   Only cells with a minimum proportion of non-missing pixels are assessed. This minimum threshold differs across CMC papers (15% in \citet{chen_convergence_2017} vs. 10% in \citet{song_estimating_2018}, as shown in \autoref{fig:cmc-schematic}), and is referenced but not specified in several other papers \citep{tong_fired_2014,song_3d_2014,chu_validation_2013}. The \code{comparison\_calcPropMissing} function computes the proportion of a matrix that is missing (\code{NA}-valued).

-   Missing values are replaced with the overall mean value when the FFT-based CCF is computed (using function \code{comparison\_replaceMissing}).

-   The optimal translation is determined using the FFT-based CCF (using \code{comparison\_fft\_ccf}).

-   Based on the optimal translation determined from the FFT-based CCF, we compute the pairwise complete CCF directly, avoiding any distortion of the CCF computation based on compensation for missing values (using function \code{comparison\_cor}).

The code below demonstrates how the \code{comparison\_allTogether} function can be used to perform the entire cell-based comparison procedure in one call. The comparison procedure is performed twice: once with Fadul 1-1 considered the "reference" scan divided into cells that are compared to the "target" scan Fadul 1-2 and again with the roles reversed.

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Fill in most of the arguments first
comp_w_pars <- purrr::partial(.f = comparison_allTogether,
                              numCells = 64, maxMissingProp = .85)

# Then, map the remaining values to theta
kmComparisonFeatures <- purrr::map_dfr(
  seq(-30,30,by = 3),
  ~comp_w_pars(reference = fadul1.1, target = fadul1.2, theta = .))

kmComparisonFeatures_rev <- purrr::map_dfr(
  seq(-30,30,by = 3),
  ~comp_w_pars(reference = fadul1.2, target = fadul1.1, theta = .))
```

The \code{comparison\_allTogether} function consists of the following steps wrapped into a single convenience function:

-   \code{comparison\_cellDivision}: Divide the reference scan into cells
-   \code{comparison\_getTargetRegions}: Extract regions associated with each reference cell from the target scan
-   \code{comparison\_calcPropMissing}: Compute missing proportions and filter out cells with a proportion of missing values above the threshold.
-   \code{comparison\_standardizeHeights}: Standardize height values
-   \code{comparison\_replaceMissing}: Replace missing values
-   \code{comparison\_fft\_ccf}: Compute CCF and estimated translations using FFT
-   \code{comparison\_cor}: Compute pairwise-complete correlation between a reference cell and a matrix of the same size extracted from the associated target region

This sequence of functions are applied for a sequence of angles $\theta$ rotating the target scan relative to the reference scan. When implementing the High CMC decision rule \citep{tong_improved_2015}, both combinations of reference and target scan are examined (e.g. A-B and B-A).

\autoref{tab:cellCCF} shows several rows of the data frame output of the \code{comparison\_allTogether} function for the comparison of Fadul 1-1 vs. Fadul 1-2 considering Fadul 1-1 as the reference scan. Although a grid of $8 \times 8$ cells was used, there were only 26 cell-region pairs that contained a sufficient proportion of non-missing values (15% in this example). The features derived from the correlation cell procedure (CCF$_{max}$, $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$, $\theta$) are used as inputs to the pipelines for assessing the similarity between scans.

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=F,message=F,eval=TRUE,cache = T}
kmComparisonFeatures %>%
  mutate(`Cell index` = cellIndex,
         `Pairwise-complete corr.` = round(pairwiseCompCor,3),

```

## Decision Rule

For each cell on the reference scan, a set of rotation angles $\theta$ with associated translations $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ and cross-correlation values are calculated. These sets need to be aggregated into a single consensus decision. Here, we describe the two pipelines implemented in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package: the original decision rule described in \citet{song_3d_2014} and the High CMC decision rule proposed in \citep{tong_improved_2015}.

The idea of a consensus decision is based on the assumption that a matching pair of cartridge cases will have similar translation and rotation values for all of the cells, while a non-matching pair of cartridge cases will exhibit a variety of different translation and rotation values without showing a particular pattern.

The first step in any CMC decision process is therefore to obtain a consensus estimate of $x, y, \theta$. Where the various CMC decision rules principally differ is in how they identify a "consensus" among the estimated $x,y, \theta$ values.

### The Original CMC decision rule {#originalMethod}

This section briefly describes the decision rule used in the first CMC paper \citep{song_proposed_2013}. For a thorough explanation of the procedure, refer to the [CMC Decision Rule Description](https://csafe-isu.github.io/cmcR/articles/decisionRuleDescription.html) vignette in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package.

Let $x_i, y_i, \theta_i$ denote the translation and rotation parameters which produce the highest CCF for the alignment of cell-region pair $i$, $i = 1,...,n$ where $n$ is the total number of cell-region pairs containing a sufficient proportion of non-missing values.

\citet{song_proposed_2013} propose the median as a consensus $(x_{\text{ref}}, y_{\text{ref}}, \theta_{\text{ref}})$ across the cell-region pairs for a particular cartridge case pair comparison. Then, the distances between the consensus values and the values for each cell comparison are assessed to determine whether the values are within a specified distance of the consensus, as determined by three threshold parameters $T_{x}, T_{y}, T_\theta, T_{\text{CCF}}$.

A cell-region pair $i$ is declared a match if all of the following conditions hold:

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:original}
|x_i - x_{\text{ref}}| &\leq& T_{x} \\ \nonumber
|y_i - y_{\text{ref}}| &\leq& T_{y} \\ \nonumber
|\theta_i - \theta_{\text{ref}}| &\leq& T_{\theta} \\ \nonumber
\text{CCF}_{\max,i} &\geq& T_{\text{CCF}}.
\end{eqnarray}
```
The CMC count is then defined as the number of matching cell-region pairs (out of $n$).

\citet{song_3d_2014} indicate that these thresholds need to be determined experimentally. There is little consensus on an optimal set of thresholds and no discussion of the sensitivity of proposed pipelines to different threshold choices across CMC papers. As such, there is little known about the effectiveness of the any CMC pipeline to "out-of-bag" samples.

\autoref{tab:thresholdTable} summarizes the thresholds used in various CMC papers.

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|lrrr|}

& (in pixels) & (in degrees) \\

\cellcolor{lightgray}{6} & \cellcolor{lightgray}{.60} \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Different thresholds for translation, rotation, and CCF$_{\max}$ are used across different papers. The range in CCF$_{\max}$ is particularly notable. There is currently no principled approach to determining these thresholds. Instead, thresholds seem to be chosen by authors through experimentation and selecting thresholds that provide promising results.}
\label{tab:thresholdTable}
\end{table}
```
Unlike the original CMC pipeline, the High CMC decision rule considers multiple rotations for each cell-region pair.

### The High CMC decision rule {#highCMCMethod}

For the High CMC decision rule, comparisons between two scans are performed in both directions, i.e. each scan takes on the role of the reference scan that is partitioned into a grid of cells. \citet{tong_improved_2015} claim that in the original decision rule, some matching cell-region pairs "may be mistakenly excluded from the CMC count" because they attain the largest CCF value at a rotation value outside the range allowed by $T_\theta$ "by chance."

To combat this, \citet{tong_improved_2015} introduce consensus values across all cell-region pairs for each rotation angle $\theta$ and calcluate a $\theta$ dependent CMC count as the sum of matches observed. A match is defined, as previously if a cell-region pair $i$ fulfills the following three conditions:

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:high-cmc}
|x_{i,\theta} - x_{ref,\theta}| &\leq& T_x \\ \nonumber
|y_{i,\theta} - y_{ref,\theta}| &\leq& T_y \\ \nonumber
\text{CCF}_{i,\theta} &\geq& T_{\text{CCF}}.
\end{eqnarray}
```
The $\theta$-dependent CMC count, CMC$_\theta$, is then defined as the sum of matching cell-region pairs.

\citet{tong_improved_2015} assert that for a truly matching cartridge case pair, the relationship between $\theta$ and CMC$_\theta$ should exhibit a "prominent peak" near the true rotation value at which the pair aligns. In contrast, truly non-matching pairs should exhibit a "relatively flat and random [...] pattern."

To determine whether a "prominent peak" exists in the relationship between $\theta$ and CMC$_\theta$, \citet{tong_improved_2015} introduce the "angular range" $R (\tau)$ as an interval of rotation angles covering high CMC$_\theta$ values. Here, $\tau$ represents another threshold value that determines the angular range as the interval of angles between $\arg \min_\theta CMC_\theta > CMC_{\text{max}} - \tau$ and and $\arg \max_\theta CMC_\theta < CMC_{\text{max}} - \tau$, where $CMC_{\text{max}}$ is defined as the maximum of CMC$_\theta$ counts across all rotation angles $\theta$. \citet{tong_improved_2015} suggest a value for $\tau$ of 1 and further determine:

> If the angular range of the "high CMCs" is within the range $T_\theta$, identify the CMCs for each rotation angle in this range and combine them to give the number of CMCs for this comparison in place of the original CMC number.

If the angular range is outside the range of $T_\theta$, we say that the cartridge case pair "fails" the High CMC criteria and the original CMC number is used. Using this definition, the High CMC decision rule returns for any comparison of breech face scans a CMC count equal to or higher to the original decision rule for both known matches and known non-matches.

### Implementation of decision rules {#decisionRuleImplementation}

In this section, we demonstrate the implementation of the decision rules in \CRANpkg{cmcR} for both the original decision rule and the High CMC decision rule. For illustrative purposes, let us consider a particular set of thresholds: $T_x = T_y = 20$, $T_{\theta} = 6$, and $T_{\text{CCF}} = .5$ values.

Decision rules in \CRANpkg{cmcR} are implemented as functions of the form \code{decision\_*}. In particular, the \code{decision\_CMC} function applies both the \jz{original and High CMC decision rules} depending on whether a value for $\tau$ is provided. The code below demonstrates the use of \code{decision\_CMC} on the features \code{kmComparisonFeatures}, extracted from the comparison of scans Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 1-2. \code{kmComparisonFeatures\_rev} contains the features from a comparison of Fadul 1-2 and Fadul 1-1. Addiionally, we also compute the CMCs under both decision rules for the comparison between the non-match pair Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 2-1 (not shown to avoid redundancy).

We can use the \code{cmcPlot} function to visualize CMCs and non-CMCs. \autoref{fig:topVoteCMCPlot} shows congruent matching cells (CMCs) and non-congruent matching cells (non-CMCs) determined under the original decision rule in blue and red, respectively. The (red) non-CMC patches are located in the position where the maximum CCF value in the target scan is attained. The top row shows 17 CMCs in blue and 10 non-CMCs in red when Fadul 1-1 is treated as the reference and Fadul 1-2 the target.

There is no discussion in \citet{song_proposed_2013} about combining the results from these two comparison directions, but \citet{tong_improved_2015} propose using the minimum of the two CMC counts (17 in this example).

Similarly, CMCs and non-CMCs determined under the High CMC decision rule are shown in \autoref{fig:highCMCPlot}. Treating Fadul 1-1 and Fadul 1-2 as the reference scan yields 19 and 18 CMCs, respectively. Combining the results as described above, the final High CMC number is 24 CMCs.

Although the individual comparisons do not yield considerably more CMCs than under the original CMC pipeline, \\citet{tong_improved_2015} indicate that the High CMCs from both comparisons are combined as the final High CMC count (each cell is counted at most once). Combining the results means that the High CMC decision rule tends to produce higher CMC counts than the original CMC pipeline. In this example, the combined High CMC count is 24 CMCs.'}

In contrast, \autoref{fig:knmCMCPlot} shows the CMC results for a comparison between Fadul 1-1 and a known non-match scan, Fadul 2-1, under the exact same processing conditions. Only one cell is classified as a congruent matching cell under the original decision rule when Fadul 1-1 is the reference scan. No cells are classified as CMCs in the other direction. While not shown, this pair fails the High CMC criteria and thus was assigned 0 CMCs under the High CMC decision rule.

The seemingly random behavior of the red cells exemplifies the assumption that cells in a non-match comparison do not exhibit an observable pattern. Random chance should be the prevailing factor in classifying non-match cells as CMCs.'}

## Ambiguity in algorithmic descriptions {#ambiguities}

During the implementation process we encountered various ambiguities in the descriptions of the various CMC pipelines. In the following section we investigate ways in which such ambiguities can be rectified by exploring a set of reproducibility principles.

<!-- It is important to note that much of what we have presented as "the CMC method" might not be considered as such by the original authors. In particular, other authors might distinguish proposed methods based only on how their decision rules differ.  -->
We include the preprocessing and cell-based comparison procedures as part of the CMC methodology to emphasize how much the final results depend on decisions made in these first two steps. The preprocessing and cell-based comparison procedures are discussed only briefly, if at all, in \citet{song_3d_2014}, \citet{tong_fired_2014}, \citet{tong_improved_2015}, or \citet{chen_convergence_2017}, yet, the results reported often indicate a sensitivity to these procedures. An actual sensitivity analysis of proposed CMC pipelines has yet to be published. Left unchecked, this can lead to results that are difficult to generalize to new data.

Apart from the CMC pipelines' generalizability, we also simply do not know how the proposed pipelines are implemented. Ambiguities in the pipelines range from minor implicit parameter choices (e.g., the convergence criteria for the robust Gaussian regression filter \citep{brinkman_bodschwinna_2003}) to procedures that fundamentally change how similarity features are extracted and compared (e.g., how the cross-correlation is calculated). As discussed in the [introduction](#intro), this is an issue that pervades computational research for which only verbal descriptions of algorithms are provided. The only solution to such ambiguity is to enumerate, implement, and pare-down the possible choices that could have been made to arrive to published results. Unsurprisingly, this process takes a considerable amount of time and resources that would be better spent furthering the state of the field.

In the next section, we describe the process of resolving these ambiguities in the CMC pipeline descriptions. In doing so, we abstract a set of principles by which pipelines and results can be rendered both computationally reproducible and more thoroughly understood.

# Investigation of cell-based forensic pattern matching pipelines {#investigation}

As described in the [initial data](#initialData) section, the set of cartridge case scans from \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} is commonly used to compare the performance of various classification methods \citep{song_3d_2014, tong_improved_2015, chen_convergence_2017}. This set consists of 40 cartridge cases and 780 total comparisons: 63 known match comparisons and 717 known non-match comparisons. Scans of each breech face impression were taken with a Nanofocus Confocal Light Microscope at 10 fold magnification for a nominal lateral resolution of 3.125 microns per pixel and published as part of NBTRD \citep{nbtrd}. While the exact procedures by which these scans were processed in the original CMC papers are unavailable, these 3D topographic surface images provide the basis of the comparison between the implementation provided in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package and published results. However, justification for any differences will ultimately involve educated hypothesization due to the closed-source nature of the original implementations.

For any cartridge case pair, the number of CMCs can be determined under the original decision rule and the High CMC decision rule described in the [implementation](#implementation) section. We have applied our implementation of these two methods to the 780 cartridge case pairs available in the \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} data set under a variety of processing conditions to determine which conditions yield the best results while also matching the published results. Perfect identification of all matching and non-matching pairs corresponds to choosing a minimum CMC count threshold that separates the distributions of the matching and non-matching CMC counts. A CMC count threshold of 6 CMCs is generally accepted as the threshold in the published papers \citep{tong_improved_2015,song_estimating_2018,song_proposed_2013}. However, this threshold has been shown to not generalize well to all proposed methods and cartridge case data sets \citep{chen_convergence_2017}. In this section, we demonstrate that the ambiguities in the [CMC pipeline descriptions](cmcMethod) and lack of guidance in the choice of parameter settings propagate through the algorithm and produce highly variable results. Additionally, wildly different parameter settings are used by the same group of authors across different papers as shown in \autoref{tab:thresholdTable}.

In the next section we focus on a discussion of the sensitivity of some of the pipeline's parameters. This presentation is far from exhaustive: we primarily focus on the factors contributing to the most variable results. As a consequence of this investigation we have developed a set of principles designed to reduce the need for brute-force searches across parameter settings when re-implementing algorithms without accompanying code. Adherence to these principles yields not only computationally reproducible results, but also improves a reader's understanding of a proposed pipeline.

## Communicating a method's sensitivity to processing conditions

Choosing threshold values $T_x, T_y, T_\theta, T_{\text{CCF}}$ for translation, rotation and maximum cross-correlation is crucial in declaring a particular cell-region pair "congruent". Many different combinations of these thresholds yield perfect separation between the matching and non-matching CMC count distributions. In situations where ground truth is known, such as in the example of the Fadul data here, we can use the ratio $r$ of between- and within-group variability as an additional statistic to measure separation between CMC counts of known matches and known non-matches. Let C$_{ij}$ denote the CMC count assigned to the $j$th cartridge case pair, $j = 1,...,n_i$, $n_1 = 63, n_2 = 717$, from the $i$th group, $i = 1,2$ representing matches and non-matches, respectively. For each set of thresholds we calculate the **Variance Ratio** $r$ as: $$
r = r\left(T_x, T_y, T_\theta, T_{\text{CCF}}\right) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2 \left(\overline{C}_{i.} - \overline{C}_{..}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{1}{n_i - 1}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \left(C_{ij} - \overline{C}_{i.}\right)^2}
$$ where $\overline{C}_{i.}$ denotes the within-group CMC count average and $\overline{C}_{..}$ denotes the grand CMC count average. Greater separation between and less variability within the match and non-match CMC count distributions yields larger $r$ values. Larger values of $r$ are therefore indicative of greater separation between the groups.

\autoref{fig:decisionRuleSensitivity_comparison} shows results for the original decision rule and the High CMC decision rule for a parameter setting of $T_{\Delta x} = 20 = T_{\Delta y}$ pixels, $T_{\text{CCF}} = .5$, and $T_{\theta} = 6$. Both decision rules result in separated CMC count distributions for known matches and known non-matches corresponding to an AUC of 1.00. However, the High CMC decision rule yields a larger separation between the known match and known non-match distributions as evidenced by the considerably larger variance ratio $r$.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap='\\label{fig:decisionRuleSensitivity_comparison} CMC count relative frequencies under the original decision rule and the High CMC decision rule for $T_{\\Delta x} = 20 = T_{\\Delta y}$ pixels, $T_{\\text{CCF}} = .5$, and $T_{\\theta} = 6$ degrees. AUC $= 1.00$ corresponds to perfect separation of the match and non-match CMC count distributions. We can see that, for this set of processing parameters, the High CMC decision rule yields higher CMC counts for known matches that the original decision rule while known non-matches have the same distribution under both methods.', fig.align='left',fig.pos='htbp',out.width='\\textwidth'}

We consider five dimensions that have a demonstrable impact on the effectiveness of the CMC pipeline. These include:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item the decision rule (original or High CMC) used,

\item whether the global trend is removed during preprocessing, and

\item choice of congruency thresholds: translation $T_x, T_y$, rotation $T_\theta$, and cross-correlation $T_{\text{CCF}}$.
\end{itemize}
```

Choosing a single parameter setting resulting in perfect identification is not enough to generally understand the algorithm. Instead, we use the variance ratio $r$ to identify promising ranges of parameters. \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} shows the value of the variance ratio under various settings. We see that the High CMC decision rule yields better separation than the original decision rule under any parameter setting. Highest variance ratios, however, are achieved for thresholds $T_x, T_y \in [10,20]$, $T_\theta = 6$, and $T_{\text{CCF}} \in [.4,.5]$. Interestingly, as seen in \autoref{tab:thresholdTable}, only the parameters for the High CMC decision rule discussed in \citet{song_estimating_2018} fall into these ranges.

```{r ,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='\\label{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} Variance ratios under are plotted for different parameter settings. High variance ratios are indicative of a a good separation between CMC counts for known matching pairs and known-non matching pairs. The High CMC decision rule generally performs better than the original decision rule. Removing the trend during preprocessing, even though not explicitly described as a preprocessing step in the CMC papers, has a major impact on the effectiveness of the CMC pipeline. In this setting, translation thresholds $T_x, T_y \\in [15,20]$, a rotation threshold $T_\\theta = 6$, and a CCF threshold $T_{\\text{CCF}} \\in [.4,5]$ lead to a separation of results.

As shown in \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter}, de-trending breech-scans in the preprocessing stage emerges as a very impactful step to achieve good algorithmic results. This step is not explicitly mentioned in the written-word descriptions of the algorithm in either of the papers by \citet{song_proposed_2013}, \citet{tong_fired_2014}, \citet{tong_improved_2015}, \citet{chen_convergence_2017}, or \citet{song_estimating_2018}, though it appears from their examples that it was used in the process. This highlights, yet again, the dangers of only providing verbal instructions in lieu of code. \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter} also shows us the benefits of breaking a pipeline up into modularized steps for an algorithmic analysis. We will expand upon this in the next section.

\jz{\autoref{fig:cmc_varRatioComparison} shows variance ratio values based on results presented in various CMC papers using data from \citet{fadul_empirical_2011} and \citet{weller_2012}. We can see that the High CMC decision rule yields higher variance ratio values than the original decision rule. However, as discussed previously, it is difficult to justify differences in these values because the various papers different preprocessing procedures and parameters (e.g., see \autoref{tab:thresholdTable}). The last two rows show the largest variance ratio values for the original and High CMC decision rules based on the grid search summarized in \autoref{fig:cmc_sensitivityScatter}. In particular, the highest variance ratio value for the original decision rule is associated with translation thresholds $T_x = T_y = 25$, rotation threshold $T_\theta = 6$, and correlation threshold $T_{\text{CCF}} = .45$. The highest variance ratio value for the High CMC decision rule is associated with translation thresholds $T_x = T_y = 20$, rotation threshold $T_\theta = 6$, and correlation threshold $T_{\text{CCF}} = .5$. This demonstrates that the implementation provided in \CRANpkg{cmcR} yields comparable results to previous CMC papers.}

## Discussion {#discussion}

\jz{\textbf{Intro to discussion}}

\jz{Reproducibility is indispensable for results to be considered valid by the wider scientific community \citep{goodman_what_2016}.
Commonly identified reasons for this lack of reproducibility include (1) ambiguity in how procedures were implemented, (2) missing or incomplete data, and (3) missing or incomplete computer code to replicate all statistical analyses \citep{leek_is_2017}.
[Outline points made below]}

\jz{\textbf{Refer back to hierarchy of algorithmic transparency with additional discussion. Conclude that, in-general, open-source and open data is the best way to ensure algorithmic transparency}}

\jz{A conceptual description of an algorithm is undoubtedly important as it can be difficult to understand an algorithm solely by reading through its source code.
However, we generally do not describe the particular parameter or processing choices made (or how they were decided) when we describe an algorithm in a publication.
It is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible, to computationally reproduce the results of an algorithm that is only described in prose.
When translating an algorithm from pseudocode, reproducibility of results is still challenging as an implementation may depend on the creator's programming habits or the programming language used.
Widely-known algorithms may be implemented differently between different languages, different libraries written in the same language, or even different versions of the same library/language (for instance, the recent change to the psuedorandom number generation algorithm used in the popular \texttt{sample()} function in R version 3.6.0).
This fact clearly also applies to implementations that are based on a conceptual description of an algorithm.
At one time, it was common to publish the specific implementation of an algorithm as raw source code \citep{bron_merge_1972} within the journal article, or at minimum, in the appendix \citep{friend_sorting_1956} if the article contained a significant amount of analysis.
As algorithms have grown in complexity, often using older, simpler algorithms as building-blocks, the use of public code repositories, such as GitHub or CRAN, has become more popular.
Open-source algorithms, accompanied with documentation detailing language/package versions, random seeds, etc., most clearly ensures computationally reproducible results in this hierarchy.
Unfortunately, it is most common in the forensic pattern-matching literature to only provide conceptual descriptions of an algorithm.
Additionally, if the processed data aren't made openly available, then computational reproduction of derivative results is suspect.
It is necessary to supplement a paper with open code and intermediate forms of the data (after any manual steps have been performed or simply as check points for replications) to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results.}

\jz{\textbf{Transition from previous paragraphs by narrowing focus to CMC algorithm. Discuss how what is currently presented isn't sufficient for replication and how the forensic science community should adopt a "culture of reproducibility."}}

\jz{In the case of the CMC algorithm, a lack of computational reproducibilty makes it impossible to truly validate, and therefore trust, the pipeline.
For example, our implementation highlights an extreme sensitivity to parameter choice that hasn't been discussed previously.
The current standard in the field is to provide a graphical or numerical summary conveying the performance of a pipeline on a particular data set under, presumably, internally optimized parameters.
While understandable from a readability perspective, broad graphical or numerical summaries do not allow us to contrast different algorithms or parameter choices at the individual comparison level.
If provided with only graphical or numerical summaries, the best we can hope for is a qualitative reproduction of results.
In recognition of the additional requirements of computational reproducibility, some journals have adopted policies encouraging or requiring that authors provide code and data sufficient to reproduce the statistical analyses, with the goal of building a "culture of reproducibility" in their respective fields \citep{peng_reproducible_2009, peng_reproducible_2011, stodden_toward_2013}.
Peer-review and scientific progress in the truest sense requires that \emph{all} pre-processed data, code, and results be made openly available \citep{kwongAlgorithmSaysYou2017, desaiTrustVerifyGuide2017}.
We argue that these standards should be adopted by the forensic science community.
Further, in the R community, computational reproducibility can largely be taken for granted due to the accessible, shared ecosystem provided by CRAN and other code repositories.
In many cases, though, authors do not make their code available for analysis; this provides a substantial hurdle when attempting to use, replicate, or compare the published pipeline and represents a significant barrier to scientific progress.}

\jz{\textbf{Narrow focus further to *our* implementation in cmcR and highlight a major benefit being the modularization of the pipeline.}}

\jz{Both the original CMC and High CMC methods are complex, multi-step processes that are easier to run and debug when written as a modular pipeline of successive, functionally independent steps. 
This modular approach makes it easier to describe the algorithm, easier to write the code, easier to modify and improve the method, and easier to show that the improvement has a noticeable impact on the results. 
Unfortunately, it takes work to explicitly modularize an algorithm. 
The modularization creates an explicit framework for assessment of the utility and effectiveness of each piece of the algorithm, and allows us to specifically manipulate each step independently, while monitoring the downstream impact on the results. 
It also allows future collaborators to improve on pieces of the pipeline, adding additional options and improving the method without having to re-invent the wheel. 
It is easy to see how modular algorithms increase the interoperability and reusability of code and data, and that the addition of an open-source software package leveraging the CRAN platform increases the findability and accessibility of the method and code.
These principles of open, accessible, interoperable code are also critical for a fair (in the legal sense) justice system: the defense must have access to the code to understand the evidence against them, lawyers must be able to assess the utility of the analysis method, and judges must be able to determine whether a method is admissible in court.}

\jz{\textbf{Conclusion to discussion}}

\jz{In this paper, we have discussed challenges that arise when an ecosystem of reproducibility does not exist.
A pure `re-implementation' of existing work generally does not count as research.
Unfortunately, this deters to build on one another's work, discourages comparisons across approaches from different research groups, and favors 'one-off' ideas over a collaborative effort to achieve real solutions.
Re-implementations often require enumerating and implementing a variety of processing options, likely larger than the scope of the original implementation, and yield a deeper understanding of a pipeline's sensitivity \citep{Stodden2013SettingTD}.
The forensic community needs to be aware of an algorithm's sensitivity and agree on a set of reasonable parameters before it is considered admissible.
Our open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells algorithm empowers the wider forensic science community to take part in the discussion of the pipeline's sensitivity.
Transparent and intuitive open-source algorithms, such as \CRANpkg{cmcR}, should be considered the gold standard in allowing the forensic science community to validate a pipeline.
We intend the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package to serve as a flexible, easy-to-use foundation upon which transparent improvements to the CMC pipeline can be developed.}

# Conclusion {#conclusion}

\jz{The results shared in this manuscript indicate that the implementation of the CMC pipeline in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package is qualitatively similar to those published in \citet{song_3d_2014}, \citet{tong_improved_2015}, \citet{chen_convergence_2017}, and \citet{song_estimating_2018}.
This is despite some ambiguities in the implementation of these procedures due to the descriptive nature of the original descriptions of the algorithms.
The fundamental reason that descriptions of data analysis procedures, combined with the raw data, are not sufficient for reproducibility is that published procedures are described in words rather than algorithmically, and in some cases, steps are performed manually without providing the resulting intermediary outcomes.
Because publications generally do not contain sufficient detail to reproduce every part of the algorithm, it is necessary to supplement the paper with open code and intermediate forms of the data (after any manual steps have been performed or simply as check points for replications).
Especially in applications like forensic science, where results from computational pipelines may be used to decide the fate of a defendant, transparency in how a pipeline is implemented and data are processed is necessary \citep{angwin_machine_2016, cino_deploying_2018}.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that the forensic community does not go only halfway, trading a subjective, human black box for objective, proprietary algorithms that are similarly opaque and unauditable.}

The process by which the CMC method was implemented in the \CRANpkg{cmcR} package testifies to how important the recent push for open-source development is to forensic transparency. \jz{Ideally, when releasing a complicated algorithm such as the CMC process, authors would provide not only code but also intermediate data files which allow others to pick up the process and modify only one stage of the algorithm. This speaks to the modularity of the data as well as the algorithm: at each stage, we must have an eye towards the reproducibility of the results. The availability of intermediate data have made the work that is demonstrated here much easier, but it would also make comparing the CMC algorithm to other alternatives much easier as well by providing a set of benchmarks to compare performance. There is a great need for these types of benchmark data sets, not only in forensics, but across the sphere of greater data science: often, solutions in one application area can be adapted to another area, but data availability ensures that these adaptations are firmly grounded.}

\jz{It also serves as an example of the implementation barriers which occur when translating textual descriptions of algorithms into detailed source code.
This process offers some insight into the necessary components which must be available for computational reproducibility.
Our experience shows that when faced with ambiguity in how a method is implemented, there are few options available to us apart from performing brute-force searches through combinations of decisions that may have yielded the results reported.
Unsurprisingly, the process is both time absorbing and computationally intensive from implementation to sifting through a wide variety of decision combinations.
The failure to ensure computational reproducibility not only imposes a general barrier to scientific progress; in this application, it also highlights the crucial need of open-source, transparent methodology in high-stakes fields such as forensic analysis.
While NIST researchers and collaborators have been able to build on the foundation of the original algorithm, the code and data necessary to reproduce the results have not been made available to external researchers.
As a result, the findings described in those papers are not computationally reproducible for the research community at large.}

\jz{If code is not open-sourced, at a minimum, authors should be willing to publish the data at every intermediate stage of the analysis, to allow those who would re-implement algorithms the ability to check the validity of the re-implementation against the output of the published paper.
This simple step protects both the authors' interest in the code and the scientific community's interest in replication and verification of previously posed pipelines.
In addition, publishing original, intermediate, and final results allows new algorithms to benchmark against previously proposed solutions to the same problem, providing a much more even basis for comparison of different algorithms.
This minimum standard of openness and reproducibility is essential to evaluating algorithms, and in consequential applications such as forensics, these validation results are also important when pipelines are introduced in a legal setting.}
