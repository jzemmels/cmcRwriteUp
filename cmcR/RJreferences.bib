 ISSN = {00063444},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2335686},
 abstract = {The problem of deciding whether two sets of fragments have come from a common source frequently arises in forensic science. This paper provides a solution in the realistic case where the distribution is nonnormal. The normal case is also discussed because it is there easier to understand the nature of the solution and, in particular, its relationship to significance tests. The solution requires the distribution function of the product of standardized normal quantities which is tabulated in the appendix.},

  abstract = {A method is described for the comparison of refractive index measurements made on control window glass, with measurements made on fragments recovered from the person of a suspect. A number of assumptions have been made in order that the treatment should be relatively simple. Consideration is given to the estimation of the evidential value of the result in the event of the two sets of measurements being found to be similar and a numerical example is given.},
