1. Introduction, 2nd to last sentence: Could you please acknowledge estimation procedures that use sampling here, for example MCMC. It would be remiss of me to let this sentence sit as it is and have my forensic colleagues repeatedly hammered in court because MCMC estimates are rarely, if ever, identical, but do fall within a certain range of variation (if the sampler has converged).

2. "open-source pattern-matching algorithms in forensics (glass (Park and Carriquiry, 2019),": I have two issues with this sentence. Firstly the goal of forensic glass analysis does not involve pattern matching. It may have a "match step" - but that is not essential as it is neither required by the court nor necessary for the computation of a likelihood ratio. Secondly, Carriqurry and Park are not expert in forensic glass analysis, nor is their work definitive. There are plenty of other papers. Evett's first paper (1977) describes in good detail how the t-test may be used in this situation. Lindley's subsequent paper in 1978 gives a Bayesian solution - again easy to implement. There are also papers by Curran and by Lucy both of which come with free open source software. I also think this sentence is untrue "the vast majority of proposed methods do not adhere to the definition of reproducibility in National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2019)." and antagonistic and does not need to be in the paper.

3. 'firearm’s unique "fingerprint" left on a cartridge case (Thompson, 2017).' - I realise you're citing a paper, but uniqueness is an unsupportable, and unnecessary requirement in forensic science. It would be good to note this. David Kaye has some good thoughts on this topic Law, Probability and Risk (2009) 8, 85−94.
