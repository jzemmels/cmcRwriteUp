The package also serves to illustrate what must be done to implement a method for which only a qualitative description is available.

<!-- When faced with ambiguity in how a method is implemented, there are few options available apart from performing a brute-force search through combinations of decisions that may have been made to yield the results reported.

<!-- While issues related to reproducibility have been identified and explored in many academic fields [\citet{baker_1500_2016}, \citet{osc_estimating_2015}, \citet{goecks_galaxy_2010}], computational reproducibility poses its own challenges.  -->
<!-- Published results may be sensitive to the particular implementation of a computational method including such considerations as data processing decisions, parameter settings, and even the chosen programming language [\citep{peng_reproducible_2011},\citet{Stodden2013SettingTD}].  -->

<!-- \hh{Publicly available, open-source implementations of algorithms are necessary to enable a true peer-review and foster further research in an area.} -->
<!-- Especially in applications like forensic science, where results from computational methods may affect legal decisions \citep{angwin_machine_2016}, or medicine, transparency in how a method or algorithm is implemented is \svp{essential}.  \svp{XXX this sentence is a bit awkward - come back to it} -->

<!-- \hh{Computational reproducibility id often taken for granted. } -->
<!-- \svp{At one time, it was common to publish the specific implementation of an algorithm as raw source code\citep{bron_merge_1972} within the journal article (or at minimum, in the appendix\citep{friend_sorting_1956} if the article contained a significant amount of analysis); perhaps this practice has become less common as the complexity of algorithms has increased XXX speculation - not sure if warranted...

<!-- While it is still relatively common to provide access to a github repository or other repository for source code, these repositories are not guaranteed to exist in perpetuity; certainly, when compared to \citep{bron_merge_1972}, the likelihood of being able to find the source code for an article is higher when the code is included in the article.  -->

<!-- \svp{I agree with Heike's assessment. Proposed structure:} -->

<!-- - Reproducibility introduction - types, why, how -->
<!--   - Cite old published algorithms -->
<!--   - highlight the importance of reproducibility and transparency for legal applications in particular - innocence project paper on algorithms -->
<!-- - Introduce case study - cartridge cases -->
<!--   - background info -->
<!-- - Step through the algorithm quoting NIST paper and then describing the different pieces of the necessary information which were missing from the paper, with pseudocode documented in section XX of the appendix referenced for each step -->
<!-- - Describe the differences between the results in the NIST paper and what we can replicate -->
<!-- - Discussion -->
<!--   - Sources of ambiguity -->
<!--     - descriptions of algorithms -->
<!--     - unspecified parameters -->
<!--     - unpublished manually cleaned data -->
<!-- - Conclusion: Open source is vital for reproducibility, and absolutely essential for applications that depend on algorithms being correct - justice, medicine, aerospace... -->

<!-- \svp{As it's structured now, this means that the intro stays, but the CMC method description gets integrated with the cmcR package description, chunk by chunk. So we pull out what they say about preprocessing, and then talk about how cmcR handles preprocessing, and so on. Then, at the end, we highlight the discrepancies and the corresponding failure to replicate the results, and talk about why that is problematic for science in general and also for the use of this algorithm in particular.} -->

<!-- An example of the breech face from a 12 GAUGE, single-shot shotgun is shown in Figure \ref{figure:barrelBF}. The hole in the center of the breech face houses the firing pin that shoots out to strike a region on the base of the cartridge case known as the \dfn{primer}. This in turn ignites the propellant within the cartridge case causing a deflagration of gases that propels the bullet forward down the barrel. Figure \ref{figure:impressionsBF} shows a cartridge case fired from the shotgun shown in Figure \ref{figure:barrelBF}. This cartridge case displays both a circular impression left by the firing pin in the middle of the primer as well as breech face impressions left on the outer region of the primer not impressed into by the firing pin. -->

 <!-- Matching an expended cartridge case of unknown source to one of known source based on breech face impressions has been performed for over 100 years by forensic practitioners \citep{firearm_id_thompson}.  -->

<!-- The development of computational and statistical methods to perform such identification has recently grown in interest \citep{council_strengthening_2009}. One such method is the Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method invented at NIST that involves partitioning a cartridge case image or scan into a grid of "correlation cells" to isolate areas containing identifying breech face impression markings \citep{song_proposed_2013}. Since its invention in 2012, researchers at NIST have developed a number of extensions and improvements of the CMC method. However, to date there does not exist an openly available implementation of any of these techniques.  -->
<!-- Many methods proposed in the CMC literature include a description of a proposed technique that does not delve into the intricacies of the implementation. Given that the implementations are not openly available, this makes it especially difficult to validate or assess results. Additionally, some procedures related to pre-processing the cartridge case data are done manually at NIST rather than with an automated method \citep{song_estimating_2018}. This compounds the difficulty to accurately reproduce results.  -->

<!-- The \pkg{cmcR} package provides an open-source, fully-automatic implementation of the CMC method as described in \citet{song_3d_2014} as well an extension proposed by \citet{tong_improved_2015}. This extension was later referred to as the "High CMC" method by \citet{chen_convergence_2017} and is referred to as such in the \pkg{cmcR} package. -->
